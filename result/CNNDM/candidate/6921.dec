Gold Coast City Council will be able to shut down illegal party houses in suburban areas after the state government approved new planning powers . 
  There are more than 700 party houses across the city . 
  The new rules mean there is now an official and legal definition of a party house . 
  Party houses are often used for unruly weekend-long parties .
