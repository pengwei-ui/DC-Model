Known as 'Ogle-2014-BLG-0124Lb,' the gas giant was detected by the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Ogle Warsaw Telescope in Chile . 
  It is half as massive as Jupiter and could help astronomers gain a better understanding of the distribution of planets in the Milky Way . 
  Most of the planets we know about are around 10-100 times closer . 
  The planet was discovered using a technique known as microlensing . 
  This happens when one star passes in front of another and its gravity acts as a lens to magnify the light .
