Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif are back to take on plastic surgery gone wrong on the second season of Botched , which premieres tonight . 
  Dr Dubrow said he and Dr Nassif were 'floored' by 60per cent of the cases they had to fix this season . 
  One of their patients had cement injected into her face at an underground cosmetic filler party .
