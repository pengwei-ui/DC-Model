United flight 3954 carried Clinton from Omaha, Nebraska to Newark, New Jersey on Thursday . 
 Met by a Town Car and a police escort – on the tarmac – for what's likely a short trip back to her Chappaqua, New York estate . 
 Follows Iowa campaign swing full of controlled interactions, staged conversations and little interaction with real people . 
 Clinton was, however, photographed pulling her own suitcase down an airport concourse .
