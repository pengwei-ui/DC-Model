  Volunteers had signals mixed up in their brains and felt an unexpected 'presence' behind them . 
  The researchers say the ghostly sensation is caused by an altered perception of their own bodies in the brain . 
  They used a robot to interfere with the sensory signals in the brains of blindfolded volunteers .
