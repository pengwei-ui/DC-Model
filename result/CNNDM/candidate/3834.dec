Alaska Department of Fish and Game Biologist Tom Seaton led 100 wood bison to freedom on a snowmobile . 
  Wood bison are North Americaâ€™s largest land mammal but the native Alaskan species disappeared from the state more than 100 years ago . 
  The species were imported from Canada to the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center in 2008 .
