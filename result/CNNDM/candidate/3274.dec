Optimal case was designed by Israel-based Amited . 
  Sensors in the case monitor the phoneâ€™s temperature and if it gets too hot, it will cool the device using two built-in micro-fans . 
  The case can also heat a phone using resistance coils if it is too cold . 
  Amited is launching an Indiegogo campaign to fund the case . 
  It will be available for Apple, Samsung, HTC & Nexus phones .
