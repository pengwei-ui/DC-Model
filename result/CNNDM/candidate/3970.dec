Hawaii scientists say a supervoid may account for an anomaly in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) of the universe . 
  In 2004 astronomers first found the ‘Cold Spot’ - a region 20 per cent less dense than elsewhere . 
  At 1 . 
 8 billion light-years across it would be the biggest object ever found . 
  The supervoid is thought to be causing a ‘less-dense’ region of universe . 
  But some ‘exotic physics’ is also needed to explain what’s happening  .
