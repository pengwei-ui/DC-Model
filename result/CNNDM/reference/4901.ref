Ella Dawson, 22, a recent graduate ofÂ Wesleyan is revealing her genital herpes status in an attempt to destigmatize the STI . 
 One in six Americans have genital herpes and that number is just among people who have been tested . 
 'When a real person, a woman you know and respect, casually mentions having herpes, it stops being a punchline and starts being someone's reality,' Dawson said .
