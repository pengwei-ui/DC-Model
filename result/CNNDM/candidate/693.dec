Researchers from London and Edinburgh have developed a computer that can collate meteorological information and then produce forecasts as if they were written by a human . 
  It uses a process known as 'natural language generation' (NLG) These computer-generated weather updates are being tested by scientists at Heriot-Watt University and University College London . 
  It has the potential to one day be used in humanoid robots on our TV screens . 
  If the project is successful a prototype system will be tested by generating local weather reports on the BBC website .
