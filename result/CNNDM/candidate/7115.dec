Anthony Bethell decided he would pay for work to restore the ancient 180-yard hedge between his home and St John's College in Warwickshire . 
  The hedge marks the boundary between Mr Bethell's home and the college's land . 
  But he claims the college has refused to agree and he has taken them to court . 
  Both parties have spent £80,000 in legal fees in a case likely to cost £150,000 . 
  A crown court judge said it is 'the most expensive hedge in WarWickshire'
