David Billing was diagnosed with mouth cancer after being unable to swallow . 
  He had to undergo 14 hours of surgery at Royal Derby Hospital to remove the tumour . 
  Surgeons sawed through his jawbone and removed part of his tongue . 
  Medics replaced the lost tissue with muscle from his arm - which still has hairs on it . 
  Mr Billing had been made redundant from his job at JCB .
