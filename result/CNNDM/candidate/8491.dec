Double Falsehood was presented by theatre impresario Lewis Theobald in 1728 . 
  He claimed it was a re-working of a Shakespeare play and was written by the Bard himself . 
  But a new study of the play's language 'strongly identifies' Shakespeare as the original author . 
  University of Texas researchers analysed 33 plays by Shakespeare and his collaborator John Fletcher . 
  They found that Shakespeare was sociable and well educated .
