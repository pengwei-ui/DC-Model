Toni Elliot, 53, thought she had hurt a tooth at Puckett's Boat House in Franklin, Tennessee . 
  When she spat out the baked oyster she discovered a pearl in the palm of her hand . 
  Forty-nine precious stones were found in the oyster at the eatery on Thursday . 
  Elliot remained calm and posed for photos with her treasure .
