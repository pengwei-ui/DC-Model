A definitive family tree of Hillary Clinton reveals her Welsh ancestors . 
 They lived in a poor mining district called Ystradyfodwg, now Rhondda . 
 Family emigrated to Pennsylvania where Mrs Clinton's grandmother Hannah Jones was born - one of four children out of 14 born to survive . 
 Hannah Jones then eloped with Hugh Rodham - Mrs Clinton's grandfather - to marry because his family probably disproved of her poor background .
