National Defense Reserve Fleet was set up in the wake of the Second World War in 1945 . 
  At its peak in 1950, the fleet consisted of nearly 2,280 ships moored across the United States . 
  Today just over 120 ships remain in the fleet, posing a risk to the environment in the bays where they are moored . 
  The ships are known as the 'Mothball Fleet' and were set to be used in national emergencies . 
  But long years of neglect and disuse have turned them into naval graveyards .
