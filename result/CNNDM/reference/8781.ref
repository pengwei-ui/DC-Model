Volvo and a start-up made Life Paint - a wash-off reflective spray for bikes . 
 Invisible spray covers anything in reflective particles and glows at night . 
 Cans were given away in London cycle shops and proved a big hit . 
 Now some are on sale on eBay and Volvo is considering selling the spray .
