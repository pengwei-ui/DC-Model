Darren Goddard 'cried himself to sleep' when he left Germany in 1989 . 
  His marriage to Lewis Helget ended after he was involved in a car accident . 
  Mr Goddard thought he would never see his son again after leaving the Army . 
  Lewis spotted his Facebook page and appealed for help finding his father . 
  The pair finally met last month after 25 years apart .
