New metro line extension in Prague didn't budget for an escalator at Nadrazi Veleslavin station . 
  Porters are carrying passengersâ€™ luggage up and down 32 stairs every day . 
  The escalator connects the metro station and an unbuilt train station . 
  The extension was supposed to be a transport hub for the airport . 
  Travellers can use a lift to the bus terminal but there is no escalator .
