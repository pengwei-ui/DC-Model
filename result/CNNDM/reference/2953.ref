The Knightsbridge flat has been put on the market for a fraction of the price of neighbouring homes, at £575,000 . 
 It has only three years left on lease putting cost at £15,000 a month -  going rate for renting a three-bed in the area . 
 Property experts said if a buyer decides to extend the lease, the property could be worth upwards of £6 million . 
 But renewal would not come cheap with the cost for a new 90-year lease estimated at between £3.35 and £4.5 million .
