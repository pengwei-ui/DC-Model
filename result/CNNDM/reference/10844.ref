Paula Dunican paid £25 for the baby blue coat at her local branch of Asda . 
 When she took it home she noticed a 'seeping' stain on the back of coat . 
 She then discovered the reptile's crushed body on the garment's lining . 
 The supermarket has apologised and offered her a £40 voucher and refund .
