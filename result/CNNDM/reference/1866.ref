The Ashton Canal became filled with heavy suds due to a 6ft wall of foam created by fire crews tackling a blaze . 
 The fire at a nearby chemical plant saw water from fire service mix with detergents that were being stored there . 
 The foam covered a 30 metre stretch of the canal near Manchester City's Etihad stadium in Clayton .
