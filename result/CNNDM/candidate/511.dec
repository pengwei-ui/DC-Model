Vet Nick Fisher said his dog Twiglet was left behaving strangely after eating the drugs he found at a bus stop in Leintwardine, Shropshire . 
  The four-year-old bedlington lurcher seemed to think he was being chased and had dilated pupils and bloodshot eyes after swallowing the unidentified substance . 
  After 45 minutes of drooling at the mouth and shaking he was back to normal . 
  Mr Fisher believes his dog may have ingested something hallucinogenic .
