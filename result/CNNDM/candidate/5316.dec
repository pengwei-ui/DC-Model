Palaeontologists in China say the new dinosaur was named Yi qi . 
  The dinosaur lived 160 million years ago and had bristle-like feathers and bat-like wings . 
  It had finger-like bones that were covered in a membrane and may have been able to glide or even fly . 
  The fossil was discovered by a farmer in China . 
  Palaeontologist say the dinosaur was an early evolutionary experiment with flight . 
  Yiqi was found to have been a vegetarian and lived in the same region as modern birds . 
  It was named because of its bizarre combination of features .
