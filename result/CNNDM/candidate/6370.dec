Italian Alex Bellini will live atop an iceberg in Greenland starting next year . 
  He will live inside a contained ball with no means to escape for 12 months . 
  The capsule will be 10ft (three metres) wide and could fit 10 people . 
  Mr Bellini is seeking funding for his project, called Adrift , which he hopes to begin in November 2016 near Greenland . 
  His goal is to see an iceberg ‘in the last phase of its long life’ as it melts . 
  The aim is to highlight how global warming will melt icebergs and cause sea levels to rise .
