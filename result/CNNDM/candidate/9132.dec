Mike Fregoe and his family of Massapequa Park built a snowman in January after a late winter storm . 
  The snowman grew to more than 9-feet tall but has now melted in 70-degree temperatures . 
  The family started a Facebook page to keep the snowman alive . 
  But on Sunday, the Frosty melted in the heat .
