Brian Williams started embellishing his stories because he felt insecure following in the footsteps of Tom Brokaw at NBC Nightly News in 2004 . 
  He was suspended in February after admitting he had lied about being on a downed helicopter in Iraq in 2003 . 
  But according to a report in Vanity Fair , he always felt insecure about following Brokah . 
  Brokaws was 'incensed' when he heard Williams exaggerations , according to former NBC employees .
