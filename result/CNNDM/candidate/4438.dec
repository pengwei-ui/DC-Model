Flight Lieutenant Stephen Beaumont took his teddy bear mascot on every flight during the Battle of Britain . 
  He was one of just seven pilots in his squadron to survive the battle and believed the bear brought him luck . 
  The teddy is expected to sell for £10,000 at auction and his uniform is up for sale for £2,000 . 
  He died in 1997 and the bear was passed to his family .
