Far-right Afrikaner Resistance Movement is training youths in military-style bootcamps northwest of Johannesburg to fight for a separate white state . 
  By day they are pushed to their physical limits with assault courses and self-defence lessons . 
  By night they are subjected to vile racist indoctrination . 
  More than 2,000 teenagers have attend AWB camp over the last two years .
