Ashley Pegram, from Summerville, South Carolina, went on a date with a man she met online on April 3 and has not been seen since . 
 Her sister found she had been messaging an 18-year-old man - but he turned out to be 30-year-old Edward Primo Bonilla . 
 Bonilla told her and police that he had kicked Pegram out of his car because she was too drunk . 
 He has been charged with obstructing justice for 'giving false and misleading information' and police say foul play is 'a definite possibility'
