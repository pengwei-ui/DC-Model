Many little amusement parks are set up in the slum areas of Pakistan on the outskirts ofÂ Islamabad and Rawalpindi . 
 The rides include merry-go-rounds, trampolines, carousels and basic swings . 
 Children who have been forced out of their villages due to fighting shriek with delight whilst enjoying the rides .
