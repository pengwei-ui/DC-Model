A researcher says a ‘bone flute’ found in Slovenia is not an instrument . 
  The bone was found in 1995 at the Divje Babe Archaeological park in Slovenia . 
  Dr Cajus Diedrich says it is simply a bone chewed by a hyena with teeth marks . 
  He says all ‘instruments’ attributed to Neanderthals are simply chew toys of animals . 
  The cave bear femur was discovered on 18 July 1995 in the park . 
  It is believed to be the oldest musical instrument discovered in Europe . 
  But Dr Diedrich said the holes are simply teeth marks from hyenas . 
  He also says the bones are not from Neanderthal times - but 30,000 years
