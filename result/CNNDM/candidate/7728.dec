Relationship counsellor Susan Pease Gadoua says traditional weddings set people up for failure . 
  She suggests a renewable marriage contract known as a 'wedlease'- She says it would work better for many couples and avoid increasing divorces . 
  Couples in a Starter Marriage agree to be together for two or three years . 
  At the end of the contract they can draw up a revised contract .
