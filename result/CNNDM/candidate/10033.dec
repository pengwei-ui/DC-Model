Andrew Hutchinson was convicted of 23 offences at John Radcliffe Hospital Oxford . 
  He raped two patients while they were under general anaesthetic and assaulted others . 
  In 2009 a student nurse reported him for taking inappropriate photographs at the hospital . 
  But bosses at Oxford University Hospitals Trust chose not to investigate . 
  He was convicted last month of making indecent images of children and voyeurism . 
  Hutchinson was reported to the hospital trust five years before the offences . 
  He worked in the A&E department of the hospital between 2011 and 2013 .
