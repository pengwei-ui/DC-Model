The photo was taken by Brad Allan in Cape York, far north Queensland . 
  Mr Allan says the image is quite fitting considering the upcoming centenary of Anzac Day . 
  The image was taken about two weeks before the 100th anniversary of the landing on Gallipoli . 
  This comes as travellers are urged to heed safety warnings and get insurance .
