Pupil Xiao Gao from Fujian in south east China has not spoken a word in five days .

  He says she let him drink it and then said 'You will die after drinking this' Medical experts are at a loss to explain his sudden inability to talk . 
  They say the combination of water, perfume and dust should not have caused him to lose his voice .
