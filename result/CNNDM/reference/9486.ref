 When tracking began in 2008 roughly 14 percent of citizens were uninsured, peaking at 18 percent in the third quarter of 2013 . 
 But marking a shift in the trend, for the first three months of this year the rate dropped to 11.9 percent . 
 The survey results were based on phone interviews conducted from January 2 to March 31 with a sample of 43,575 adults ages 18 and older .
