Charles and Camilla were invited to fit bungs to the casks on a tour of the Ballindalloch Distillery in Aberdeenshire . 
  But they will have to wait eight to 10 years to sample the single malt as owners plan to allow it to mature . 
  The whisky from both casks will then be bottled to the benefit of the royal visitors' charities .
