Tyler Kost was arrested last May for sexual crimes against 13 girls between 13 and 17 years old . 
  He appeared in court on Monday and faces 30 charges in three indictments ranging from sexual abuse to child molestation . 
  Kost's defense said new evidence taken from Facebook and Instagram proves the women lied about sexual abuse . 
  The prosecution handed over 98,000 pages of social media records from several of the alleged victims . 
  But the lawyers want further access to Facebook accounts to prove it . 
  The 19-year-old is accused of sexually assaulting several girls at his former high school .
