Mazzy was on board a Southwest Airlines flight over the US when the entire airplane sang her happy birthday and brought her to tears of joy . 
 Mazzy, who just turned four, suffers from Spina Bifida and is paralyzed from the waist down . 
 The crew of the airplane made Mazzy a crown from pretzels and a birthday cake made from toilet paper .
