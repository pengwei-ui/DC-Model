Baby boy was found wrapped in a blanket in a Sainsbury's bag floating on a Norfolk pond in June 1988 . 
  Police exhumed his body last year as part of a case review and DNA samples led them to his mother . 
  She was arrested on suspicion of infanticide but the charge was dropped . 
  She said the baby was stillborn and she had concealed the pregnancy from her family and friends . 
  The boy was reburied at Weasenham St Peter church in Norfolk . 
  Police have ruled out foul play in the case .
