Adele McKenzie was set to marry her partner of nine years in November . 
  She paid $1,000 to 'The Bridal Centre' for her wedding dress . 
  In April she received an email saying the company was going bankrupt . 
  She was one of around 140 brides who received the same email . 
  The brides-to-be banded together to set up a Facebook page . 
  They were told their dream dresses may not be coming . 
  Ms McKenzie was devastated to learn she had already paid for half of the dress .
