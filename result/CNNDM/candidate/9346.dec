Detective Inspector Kelvyn Ashby said he was appalled by the Labour peerâ€™s note . 
  The note thanked him for how he had dealt with the issue and invited him and his wife to dinner at Parliament . 
  He was forced to drop inquiries into alleged sex abuse . 
  Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders ruled that the 86-year-old peer should not face prosecution because of his dementia . 
  Detectives have carried out four child sex inquiries into Janner since 1991 .
