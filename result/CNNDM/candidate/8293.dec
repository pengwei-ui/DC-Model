Tensions have remained high at the Sugar Pine Mine near Medford after the facility was served with a federal stop-work order . 
  The owners summoned armed guards from the conservative Oath Keepers activist network ahead of a major protest outside local offices of the Bureau of Land Management yesterday . 
  The mine received the order last month and the owners have appealed it . 
  At issue is a dispute over mine ownership records . 
  Miners argue they have exclusive surface rights and need not follow federal regulations . 
  Owners insist they want to avoid a high profile stand-off .
