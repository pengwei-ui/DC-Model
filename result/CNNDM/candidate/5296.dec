State Government plans to make public housing tenants pay a bond to recoup losses from damaged properties . 
  Communities Minister Brad Hazzard said the annual bill for repairs and maintenance on taxpayer-funded housing had hit $12 million . 
  He said it was a 'very likely possibility' the plan would be implemented in the near future . 
  Tenants are already liable for damage but 'they don't have the money'
