Study looked at the voting habits of twins born in the UK . 
  The aim was to explore how much nature and nurture influence our party political allegiances . 
  The Department of Twin Research found identical twins were more likely to vote the same way than the non-identical twins . 
  They found voting Conservative was strongly influenced by genetics . 
  But voting for the Lib Dems was affected entirely by environment .
