 Suffering from dementia and Alzheimers, she had been moved into a nursing home by her daughters from a previous marriage last year .

 He ignored the request and charges were filed against him days after his wife died last August . 
 Rayhons faces 10 years in prison if he is found guilty of sexual abuse charges .
