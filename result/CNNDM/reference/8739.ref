The whales washed up along a 6 mile stretch of coast near Hokato, Japan . 
 Experts have dismissed rumours of impending earthquake as unscientific . 
 The strandings sparked comparisons with the appearance of 50 melon-headed whales six days before the earthquake in 2011 that left 19,000 dead . 
 Officials instead believe the whales may have suffered a parasitic infection while others say the animals may have been attempting to avoid predators .
