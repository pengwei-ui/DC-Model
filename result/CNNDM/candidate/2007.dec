New York City's Landmarks Law turns 50 on Sunday . 
  New exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York looks at the destruction of iconic buildings before the law . 
  The 1963 demolition of Pennsylvania Station led to the creation of a commission to preserve historic places . 
  The commission can designate historic places as landmarks and prevent them from being demolished . 
  The law was established after the loss of Penn Station to make way for Madison Square Garden .
