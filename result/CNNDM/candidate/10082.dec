Researchers at Stanford University examined the reaction of teachers in the US to student race . 
  They found teachers were more likely to view black pupils as troublemakers than those they thought were white . 
  In the US black students are disproportionately punished for misbehaviour . 
  Teachers also tended to want to discipline black students more harshly .
