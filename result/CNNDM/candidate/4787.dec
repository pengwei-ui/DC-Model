INXS guitarist Kirk Pengilly and his wife Layne Beachly won a legal battle against their neighbour Wendy Goyer . 
  Ms Goyer claimed her 'small but charming view' would be 'destroyed' by additions to their home . 
  Warringah council approved the additions to the couple's northern beaches home in August 2013 . 
  The couple argued her views are 'at best only a glimpse' from her bedroom . 
  Justice Rachel Pepper dismissed her case on Wednesday .
