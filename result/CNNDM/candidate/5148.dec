Charlesetta Taylor, 79, has lived in her home of 70 years in St . 
  Louis for the city to make way for a campus for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency . 
  Taylor was part of the first African-American family to live in her neighborhood . 
  The city may also tear down 49 other homes in addition to her home . 
  This is so the city can keep the NGA and the 3,000 jobs it provides in the city . 
  Taylor has started a petition to stop the city from tearing down her home and 49 others .
