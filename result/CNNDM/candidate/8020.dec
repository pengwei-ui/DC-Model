Zookeeper Elad Hershkowitz placed a GoPro camera at the bottom of water troughs at the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv . 
  He filmed animals drinking on the camera for a total of 30 hours and then cut the footage down to four minutes . 
  The animals range from a rhino who almost kisses the water to a lemur who delicately licks it .
