Environment Agency says it has a legal duty to protect water voles as an endangered species . 
  £135,000 was spent trapping and moving 55 of the creatures from the Somerset Levels ahead of dredging work . 
  In January and February 2014 residents on the Levels were forced to abandon their homes . 
  The bill for moving the creatures is nearly six times the original estimate .
