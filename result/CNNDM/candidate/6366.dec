Shoe that Grows uses adjustable buckles and a strap on the toe to expand by five sizes . 
  Kenton Lee came up with the idea while working in Nairobi in Kenya . 
  The sandal has adjustable points at the front, sides and the back to help it expand . 
  Pressure sensors in the shoe tell it when your foot is in position to lace up . 
  It comes in two sizes and a single pair costs $30 (Â£20) The shoes will be sent to orphanages in Africa to help children grow .
