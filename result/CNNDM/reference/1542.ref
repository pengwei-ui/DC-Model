Wellness guru and app developer Belle Gibson lied about having cancer . 
 'No, none of it is true,' she told Australian Women's Weekly . 
 'I am still jumping between what I think I know and what is reality', she said . 
 Leading psychologist believes Gibson could be suffering from both anti-social behaviour and narcissism disorders . 
 Jo Lamble says the wide adoption of technology and social media mean that small lies can easily get out of hand .
