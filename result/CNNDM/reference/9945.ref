Aidan Fraley, 16, says his father Eric Harris' killer Robert Bates should never have been allowed to work as a Tulsa deputy . 
 Fraley says the police at the scene and those who allowed Bates on the streets are to blame but his mother Cathy Fraley says she forgives Bates . 
 Bates has said he mistakenly pulled out a handgun rather than a stun gun when he fatally shot Eric Harris on April 2 as he lay on the ground .
