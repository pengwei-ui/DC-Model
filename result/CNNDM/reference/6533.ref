An Australian bat has found an unlikely cure for his arthritis in a cup of tea . 
 The 22-year-old bat picked up the taste while drinking from his owner's cup . 
 The rest of the 25 bats in the aviary have acquired a taste for the tea too . 
 While it may look like regular tea it is his own purpose-made tea .
