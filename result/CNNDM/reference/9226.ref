UEFA have ordered the final 18 seconds of the European Women's U19 Championship qualifier between England and Norway to be replayed . 
 Referee Marija Kurtes incorrectly awarded an indirect free kick after disallowing an England penalty for encroachment . 
 FIFA did something similar during a 2006 World Cup qualifier . 
 But the entire match between Uzbekistan and Bahrain was replayed . 
 UEFA must hope it doesn't affect one of their premiere tournaments .
