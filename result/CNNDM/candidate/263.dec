Patrick O'Flynn said Ukip needs to 'work harder' as it is 'lagging' with female voters . 
  He launched the party's 'policies for women' alongside Suzanne Evans and MEP Diane James . 
  Polls suggest 15 per cent of men are planning to back Ukip compared to 10 per cent for women . 
  Mr O’Flynn was forced to defend the party’s ‘blokeish’ image under Nigel Farage .
