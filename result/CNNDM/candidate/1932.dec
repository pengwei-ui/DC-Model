Fanuc CR-35iA claims to be the first ‘heavy-lifting industrial collaborative robot’ to work with humans without the need for safety fences . 
  It uses integrated vision technology to keep an eye on humans and automatically stops if it touches an operator . 
  The robot can lift up to 77 lbs (35kg) and could be used in a number of industries . 
  Coventry-based company Fanuc claims the robot is the first of its kind . 
  It has a protective green covering so it doesn’t ‘pinch’ workers .
