Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was wounded by an attack from the US-led coalition in March in Nineveh . 
  He is no longer in control of Isis but is slowly recovering but does not have the reins of the group . 
  He was left so weakened that his inner circle reportedly mooted the idea of naming a new leader . 
  Source said he was wounded while travelling in a three-car convoy .
