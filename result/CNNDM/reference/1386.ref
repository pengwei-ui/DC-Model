Demi Moore and Bruce Willis purchased the south tower penthouse at the San Remo in 1990, in addition to a maisonette on the lobby floor . 
 Moore appears to have won the penthouse in the couple's 2000 split . 
 She is now selling the 14-room penthouse at a $75million asking price, since she doesn't spend much time at the home anymore . 
 If it sells at that price, it will break the record for most expensive Upper West Side co-op ever sold . 
 Moore and Willis were married for 13 years and share three daughters .
