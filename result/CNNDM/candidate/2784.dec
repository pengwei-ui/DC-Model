Nasa has put together a team of 'extraterrestrial experts' to see if any of the planets discovered outside our solar system are habitable . 
  The initiative is dubbed Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (Nexss) and will include scientists from 10 universities . 
  It says amateur astronomers could help with its 'unprecedented' search for ET by accessing research data online . 
  Nasa has set up a website for the public called Planet Hunters . 
  Last month the space agency said we will find aliens in the next 10 to 20 years .
