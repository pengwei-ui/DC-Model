Gregg Manderson, 68, of St Paul, Minnesota, has auditory hallucinations . 
 He sought help for Condition  last May when lullaby Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star crept into his head . 
 Songs, which have included  police sirens, last for about a month, but for years he has heard a bugle call that could be linked to his time in Vietnam . 
 Manderson originally didn't know . 
 Theme song to the 1950s Western show Cheyenne also often in his mind .
