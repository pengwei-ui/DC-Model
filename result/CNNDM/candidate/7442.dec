Magma chamber in Yellowstone National Park releases 45,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide each day . 
  A magma chamber beneath the surface is not considered large enough to produce such levels . 
  University of Utah researchers tracked seismic waves from almost 5,000 earthquakes to find the source in a secondary chamber deeper underground . 
  The chamber is so large its partly-molten rock could fill the Grand Canyon 11 times over . 
  It sits 12 to 28 miles (19 to 45km) beneath the supervolcano and measures 11,035 cubic miles (46,000 cubic km)
