Cleveland's Variety Theater was a renowned rock venue that hosted the likes of Metallica, REM and Dead Kennedy's . 
 But as metal band Motorhead performed in 1984, the ceiling cracked and plaster began to fall on to the audience . 
 The gig was stopped and the theater was sealed off two years later - staying hidden from the public for 30 years . 
 Now a photojournalist has ventured into the building, capturing eery photos that offer a glimpse into music history .
