Images show a shoal of fish making way for a blacktip shark swimming in the shallow waters of Heron Island in Queensland . 
  Software engineer Scott Carr was looking for photos before his wedding . 
  It is thought that the fish are instinctively frightened of the shark . 
  They create a circle of clear water around the shark to keep it out of the way . 
  Scientists say this is typical behaviour for shoaling fish .
