John Helinski, 62, slept in a cardboard box in Tampa Bay for three years . 
 He applied for homeless housing, but struggled as he had no identification . 
 It had all been stolen years earlier - virtually forcing him onto the streets . 
 A case worker and a cop looked into his past and uncovered his records . 
 Helsinki then went into a Tampa bank and discovered a lost account . 
 Enough money and social security was in there for him to buy a house .
