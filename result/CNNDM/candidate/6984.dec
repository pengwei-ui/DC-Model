Scientists at the University of Connecticut say we know how far away the source of a sound is by listening to the echoes it produces . 
  In a study they found that the reverberation of sound helps us locate the distance of, for example, a car passing round a bend or a person nearby  . 
  The research was conducted by scientists from the university and published in the Journal of Neuroscience . 
  They said echoes and fluctuations in volume are the cues we use to figure out the distance between us and a noise .
