Residents in Farnham branded waste collection squads as 'little Hitlers' for enforcing recycling rules . 
  Binmen said bag of Walkers prawn cocktail crisps fell foul of the rules â€“ even though it had been dropped there by a litterbug and not the owner of the bin . 
  Elsewhere they left another bin full of rubbish because there was a scrap of cellophane on its lid . 
  Residents have been told to remove non-recyclable material from wheelie bin lids .
