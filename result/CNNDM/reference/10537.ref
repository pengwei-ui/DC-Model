Scott Quigg and I have taken all the risks - Carl Frampton must step up . 
 We've written him a cheque for Â£1.5million so what is stopping them?I've also held talks with Kiko Martinez and Nonito Donaire for July 18 . 
 Kell Brook vs Frankie Gavin under strong consideration for May 30 . 
 Anthony Joshua will probably fight again on May 9 in Birmingham .
