Jessica Mejia, 20, died when her drunk ex-boyfriend smashed their car into a pole in Cook County, Illinois in December 2009 . 
 Sheriff's deputies improperly undressed the young woman's body at the scene and took photographs of her, according to her mother's lawsuit . 
 But the sheriff's office says it was necessary to take the photographs in order to preserve evidence that ultimately put the ex-boyfriend behind bars . 
 The case goes to trial next week .
