Newcastle set another record as losers of the last five Tyne-Wear derbies . 
 They played in grey and put in an equally dismal and uninspired display . 
 Defeat came after Newcastle announced club record profit of Â£18.7million . 
 They were left to rue decision to ditch their black and white stripes .
