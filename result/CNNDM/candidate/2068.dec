French team found ocean waves colliding generate seismic activity but it takes 13 seconds or less to complete a single oscillation . 
  The hum was caused by the Johanna storm in March 2008 . 
  Waves collide near the surface and create weak microseismic waves . 
  These combine with long waves on the ocean's floor to create the constant hum .
