Dr Milton Wainwright claims he has new evidence of 'extra-terrestrial organisms' floating 25 miles (40km) above Earth . 
  He says the organisms test positive for DNA and have masses that are 'six times bigger than the size limit of a particle which can be elevated from Earth to this height' The organisms are contained in a metal globe designed to 'seed' alien life on Earth . 
  His views have been widely dismissed by the scientific community . 
  He has been trying to convince academics that he has found aliens in Earth's stratosphere for several years .
