Ralph Body was once a beloved figure at the front desk of the building 27 on 27th in Queens . 
 The concierge says he was fired last week and now believes it was because he was too willing to help affluent tenants--even after his shifts . 
 Some tenants are gathering signatures to get 41-year-old Body reinstated as the building's ever-effervescent doorman .
