Bill Parker, 34, of Gulfport was mowing his lawn on April 19 when the wire entered his left nostril and was lodged in his sinus cavity . 
  He thought a rock had hit him in the face but a scan revealed it was a three-and-a-half inch metal fence wire . 
  Dr Timothy Haffey removed the wire in a 20-minute sinus surgery and said it dodged all of Parker's important nerves and arteries .
