Israeli geologist Dr Arye Shimron says he has linked the James Ossuary to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood . 
  He ran 150 chemical tests and found traces of magnesium, iron and silicon from the box matched the signature of the tomb . 
  The tomb was found in 1980 and some believe it holds the bones of Jesus and his brother Joseph . 
  Research could have implications for whether Jesus was married and fathered a child .
