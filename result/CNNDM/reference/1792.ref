It has cost the taxpayer £135,000 to move 55 protected water voles . 
 They have been removed from Somerset Levels for dredging to take place . 
 In  2014 over 600 homes and 17,000 acres of farmland were flooded with water after rivers burst their banks following years of insufficient dredging . 
 Critics say moving the voles is an unnecessary waste of public money .
