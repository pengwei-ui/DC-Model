Demi Moore is selling the Upper West Side apartment she once shared with ex-husband Bruce Willis for $75million . 
  The actress and Willis purchased the 14-bedroom penthouse in 1990 . 
  If it sells for that much it will break the record for the most expensive co-op sold on the West Side . 
  Moore and Willis split up in 2000 and she says she doesn't spend much time at the home . 
  The apartment is exactly half of her estimated fortune of $150million .
