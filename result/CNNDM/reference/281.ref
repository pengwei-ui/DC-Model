An estimated 1,000 dance halls that sprung up around Texas in the 1800s, knitting together German, Czech, Polish and other immigrant communities . 
 From about 1870 into the 1920s, European immigrants in Texas built hundreds of these halls . 
 They largely served as meeting places for agricultural groups, rifle clubs and mutual benefit societies . 
 About 400 such halls still stand â€” many unused and decaying . 
 Only two traditional Texas dance halls continue to operate on nearly a daily basis: Luckenbach Hall and Gruene Hall . 
 Texas Dance Hall Preservation and other groups are working to preserve the state's remaining dance halls .
