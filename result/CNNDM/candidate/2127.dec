Scientists at the Rockefeller University in New York believe a new antibody therapy could pave the way for an HIV vaccine . 
  Clinical trials revealed the treatment resulted in a 300-fold decrease in the amount of virus in a patient's blood - their viral load . 
  The antibody was designed to block the key viral protein receptor that is needed to infect human blood cells . 
  Patients injected with the antibody saw a reduction in viral load of the virus . 
  Scientists believe the therapy could lead to a new vaccine to prevent infection .
