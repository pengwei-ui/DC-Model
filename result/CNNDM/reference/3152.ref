Apple Watch Sport edition costs $349 (£299) and has an Ion-X glass screen . 
 'Durable' screen shattered when the watch's face hit the ground first . 
 Screen damage is not covered for free repairs in the Apple Watch warranty . 
 But another test has shown the device lives up to Apple's waterproof claims after it survived 15 minutes in a swimming pool .
