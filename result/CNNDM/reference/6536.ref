Manchester United paid almost £30million to sign Luke Shaw last summer . 
 Deal made Shaw the most expensive teenage footballer of all time . 
 He has not appeared for United since being substituted against Arsenal . 
 Louis van Gaal has told the young left back he is not fit enough . 
 Shaw is a home boy and has struggled to adapt to new life in Manchester . 
 He has found  a manager who has very specific and exacting demands .
