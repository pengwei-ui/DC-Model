Researchers at the University of North Carolina tested a 10-Hertz current on the brain of 20 volunteers to stimulate the brain's natural alpha wave oscillations . 
  These oscillations - or the lack of them - are linked with depression . 
  They claim the current can boost creativity by nearly eight per cent .
