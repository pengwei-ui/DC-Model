Nico Rosberg was the last driver out of the pit-lane and was forced to turn in a quicker out-lap than he would have liked ahead of his final shot at pole . 
 The German narrowly lost out  to his team-mate Lewis Hamilton . 
 Rosberg was just 0.042secs slower than his Mercedes rival . 
 Rosberg also said: 'Oh, come on, guys', over the team radio after he was informed he'd missed out on pole for Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix .
