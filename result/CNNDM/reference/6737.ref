Queen Victoria's holiday residence was Osborne House on the Isle of Wight . 
 But her journeys there involved train and ferry ride and then another train ride to a station more than two miles from the property . 
 In 1875, a station was built at Whippingham just to serve Royal residence . 
 Building is now a five-bedroom home, currently on the market for £625,000 .
