Hardy was convicted of domestic abuse against ex-girlfriend Nicki Holder and was suspended from the Dallas Cowboys for 10 days by the NFL . 
 Charges were eventually dropped after Holder could not be located when Hardy's lawyers appealed the decision and asked for a jury trial . 
 This week he got stuck in his Bentley in deep flash flood waters in Dallas . 
 Hardy was forced to abandon his car and it was towed away hours later .
