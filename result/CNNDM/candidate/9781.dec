Designer Eason Chow from Singapore says he took inspiration from sugar-coated sweets in gumball machines . 
  He covered coffee granules in milk powder then dipped them in water to dissolve them . 
  The pods will cost around £4 for a pack of 20 and the machine will cost £80 . 
  He came up with the idea after realising how much waste is generated from coffee capsules each year .
