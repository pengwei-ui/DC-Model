Evansville in Comanche County, Kansas, was home to a post office, a grocery store and even a school house in the 1870s and 80s . 
  But now, the ghost town is a shadow of its former self, with its commissary building in a state of disrepair . 
  Four ranchers moved to the area in the 70s and 1880s and set up the largest cattle ranch in Kansas history . 
  However, the town is still home to two final residents - rancher Larry 'Dee' Scherich and his wife .
