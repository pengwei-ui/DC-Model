Jared McCarroll is the head chef at M Restaurant and Grill in London . 
  Allow your meat to come to room temperature before cooking it . 
  The best steak should have a fine texture and be firm to the touch . 
  Speak to your butcher when you are shopping for the best cut of meat . 
  Cook the steak straight on the grill or in a pan .
