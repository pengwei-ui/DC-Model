UK researchers studied the asteroid impact 66 million years ago . 
  They found the heat near the impact site in Mexico was not intense enough to ignite plant material . 
  A heat pulse lasted less than a minute, too short to set plants alight . 
  Researchers plan to drill 5,000 feet (1,500 meters) below the surface of the Chicxulub crater in Mexico to try and answer the question of how the dinosaurs died out . 
  The core they hope to retrieve will allow them to look back in time 10 million to 15 million years into the past . 
  Previous researcher has questioned the theory that a global firestorm accompanied the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs . 
  The impact site is believed to be the 125 mile (
