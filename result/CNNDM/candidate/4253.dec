Birmingham Airport could be rebranded 'Shakespeare's Airport' in the U . 
 S . 
  to attract more tourists from China . 
  But there are concerns that not enough Americans will know the famous playwright . 
  The airport could also be called 'Birmingham London' as HS2 rail link will make it just 38 minutes from the centre of the capital . 
  A similar rebranding in China has attracted thousands of tourists .
