Artist Frank McKeever from Florida created these amazing posters . 
  They show how we could colonise various worlds in the solar system . 
  Included are humans skiing on a moon of Uranus and living in cities on Mars . 
  Others show life on Europa and near Saturn - and a destroyed Earth . 
  The posters were created by artist and entrepreneur Frank Mc Keever from St Augustine in Florida . 
  He hopes the posters encourage us to expand our presence .
