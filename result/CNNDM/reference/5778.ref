Filmmaker Michael KÃ¶nig from Cologne, Germany has created an amazing video showing solar activity . 
 It was made by stitching together footage from Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory over five years . 
 The footage includes loops of 'coronal rain' showering the surface of the sun . 
 Transits of the moon, Venus and Earth are also seen - and a comet breezes through the outer solar atmosphere .
