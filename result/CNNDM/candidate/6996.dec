Painting 'Bomb Damage' was drawn on a metal door in northern Gaza . 
  Rabie Dardouna said he has been tricked into selling the door to a local artist for just Â£100 . 
  He is unaware that Banksy's works are usually valued at hundreds of thousands of pounds . 
  The popular street artist is believed to have visited Gaza earlier this year . 
  The painting is drawn on the last remaining part of a house in the area . 
  But he is now demanding the door is returned after being told of its value .
