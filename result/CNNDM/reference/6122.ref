Tony Morris QC is mounting landmark legal challenge in Queensland . 
 His blue Volvo was caught doing 57km/h in a 50km/h zone last year . 
 He says he wasn't behind the wheel but won't the name person who was . 
 He has invoked a spousal privilege case from 1817 . 
 It means a husband can't be compelled to  incriminate his wife .
