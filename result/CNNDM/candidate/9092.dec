ISIS released photos show crates of chicken being set alight in a field near the city of Aleppo . 
  The meat was slaughtered according to Islamic law and was perfectly fit for consumption . 
  The food was burned after the jihadis noticed labels on the boxes that suggested the birds had been reared and slaughtered in the United States . 
  It is believed the meat was destined for starving refugees in the city .
