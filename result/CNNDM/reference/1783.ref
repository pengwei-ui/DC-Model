California Gov. Jerry Brown ordered state officials Wednesday to impose mandatory water restrictions for the first time in history . 
 Brown said he signed an executive order requiring measures be implemented to cut water usage by 25 percent compared with 2013 levels . 
 State water officials found no snow on the ground at the site for their manual survey of the snowpack . 
 Snow supplies about a third of the state's water . 
 A higher snowpack translates to more water in California reservoirs to meet demand in summer and fall .
