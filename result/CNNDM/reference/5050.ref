Hiroshi Ueda patented the 'extender stick' at camera firm Minolta in 1983 . 
 He came up with the invention after struggling to find anyone to take pictures of him with his wife while they were on a family holiday in Europe . 
 It used a mirror on the front of compact cameras to help the photographer . 
 But the idea was not a commercial success and the patent ran out in 2003 .
