Binh Wagner, a 3-year-old Vietnamese girl adopted by an Ontario family, was recovering Monday following a liver transplant . 
 Earlier this year, her twin Phuoc received a liver from their adopted fatherÂ Michael Wagner but Binh's fate remained uncertain . 
 The identical twins suffer from a genetic disease called Alagille syndrome, which leads to a buildup of bile in the liver, causing damage to liver cells .
