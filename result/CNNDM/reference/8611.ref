Trooper Abraham Martinez jumped into the air and kicked Steven Gaydos off his bike following a high-speed chase in Houston in December 2012 . 
 Gaydos ran a stop sign and fled while driving on a suspended license . 
 Martinez shot at him four times - striking him in the leg - and when the man pulled over, he kicked him off his bike . 
 Martinez was suspended for three days for the unconventional move . 
 The video emerged this week as a Texas newspaper investigated outdated tactics used in Department of Public Safety pursuits .
