Oldham council moved Broadway Allotment Association to new site . 
  Old prize-winning site has been bulldozed to make way for a car park and five-a-side football pitches . 
  Gardeners say soil at new site is so poor they can't grow a bean and seedlings are rotting . 
  They are demanding council pays out compensation for the problems in Failsworth, Oldham .
