Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders accused of ignoring rights of victims and failing to clear speculation of a cover-up . 
  Ms Saunders ruled not to charge Lord Janner despite evidence of 22 offences against nine victims . 
  She said decision was justified because of his poor health due to Alzheimerâ€™s Disease . 
  Campaigners and police chiefs have called for Ms Saunders to stand down .
