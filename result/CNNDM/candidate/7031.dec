Alison Hall was at work when she took a puff on her asthma inhaler . 
  She took a sharp breath and felt something shoot to the back of her throat . 
  The false nail became lodged in her throat and she was choking for five minutes . 
  Mother-of-one said it was part of a cheap Â£1 . 
 50 set she had used weeks before . 
  She believes the nail worked its way in through a gap at the top .
