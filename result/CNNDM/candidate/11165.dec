Jay Brittain was worried that the baby owls at Small Breeds Farm Park and Owl Centre look so similar at birth that he could end up overfeeding them . 
  So he instructed workers to varnish the claws of each fluffy owlet using nail polish in their very own 'talon salon' The first born Tawny owl is given orange talons . 
  The second hatched has theirs painted purple and for the third born, pink . 
  So far seven owlets born to two different mother's have been given the manicures .
