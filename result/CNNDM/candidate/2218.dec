Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust paid a temporary nurse Â£183 an hour to cover a single 12-hour shift . 
  The figure equates to double the rate for a neurologist and was revealed following a Freedom of Information request . 
  47 agency nurses were working at the trust in December last year . 
  Trust has been criticised for wasting taxpayers' money amid shortage of trained nurses . 
  But director of nursing said temporary staff had to be used to cover shortfall in nurses .
