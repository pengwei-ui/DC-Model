Volvo teamed up with a Swedish start-up to make a light reflective spray for cyclists . 
  Life Paint is a reflective safety spray . 
  It’s invisible by daylight but reflects light in the dark to alert drivers to cyclists . 
  Volvo launched the paint to increase the visibility of cyclists on the road . 
  It contains powder-fine reflective particles designed to react to a car‘s headlights . 
  The trial cans were given away for free in cycling shops in London . 
  Some of the cans are now on sale on eBay for £45 ($66)
