Yi qi is thought to have lived 160 million years ago during the late Jurassic . 
 The dinosaur has an unusual bone sticking out of its wrist and had a membrane that covered it to form a wing much like that of a modern bat . 
 Scientists say it is unlike any other dinosaur, which evolved into birds, and may have glided or even been able to fly by flapping over short distances . 
 The fossil was discovered by a farmer in Qinglong County in north China .
