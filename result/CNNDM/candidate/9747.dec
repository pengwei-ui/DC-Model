University of Kentucky guard Andrew Harrison directed a racial slur at University of Wisconsin player Frank Kaminsky after the Wildcats lost 71-64 to the Badgers Saturday night . 
  Harrison covered his mouth and said 'f*** that n****' into a live microphone when another player was asked a question about Kaminsky . 
  He has since apologized for his comment . 
  Kaminsky has said he is 'over it' and 'nothing needs to be made out of it' The Wildcats lost the semi-final game to Wisconsin and will face Duke in the championship game Monday .
