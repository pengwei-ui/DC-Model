Scientists at Harvard Medical School developed a module that can be attached to the camera of an iPhone 4s to analyse samples for signs of cancer . 
  The device uses the powerful cameras in combination with tiny beads that bind to cancerous cells . 
  When added to a tissue or blood sample, these microbeads bind to any cancerous cell in the sample and produce distinctive diffraction patterns . 
  A tissue sample is mixed with these beads and then placed on a slide . 
  This is then inserted into a clip on module that clips onto a smartphone . 
  The researchers claim it can asses 100,000 cells from a single image in less than 45 minutes . 
  They have already tested the device to detect cervical cancer . 
  Each test costs Â£
