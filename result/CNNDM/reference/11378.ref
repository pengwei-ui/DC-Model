Not all turtles can swim, said Florida wildlife officials this week after concerned beachgoers tried to throw baby tortoises in the ocean . 
 There were at least three reports of people trying to release gopher tortoises in the ocean because they were mistaken for sea turtles . 
 Tortoises have toes with claws on each toe but sea turtles have flippers with just one or two claws on each fore flipper .
