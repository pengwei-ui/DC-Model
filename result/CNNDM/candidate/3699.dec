NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel was kidnapped in Syria in December 2012 and held for five days . 
  He was convinced he had been taken by government affiliated forces . 
  But the broadcaster has now said he was most likely taken by Sunni rebels . 
  They tried to convince him they were Shi-ite rebels affiliated with the Assad regime . 
  Mr Engel was released for 'propaganda purposes' after five days in captivity . 
  He had previously claimed he was taken by forces associated with President Bashar al-Assad .
