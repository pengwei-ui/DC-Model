The State Library is showing a collection of photographs taken in the 1800's by the first hand held camera . 
 The photographs were taken in the 1880's by Arthur Syer, a 27-year old man living in Sydney . 
 The hand held camera was the first time people could be photographed without their knowledge . 
 Amateur photographers using the 'Detective Camera' initiated the first talks about surveillance and privacy laws . 
 This was also the first chance people had to use a camera if they weren't trained in the science behind photography . 
 The exhibition will run from April 4 to August
