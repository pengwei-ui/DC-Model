Photos show Maria Sidorova and Lidia Fetisova hugging and kissing the 650kg bear named Stephen in a forest outside Moscow in Russia .

  One model was pictured wearing a fur coat despite the anti-hunting message . 
  Stephen was rescued by his owner Yuriy Panteleenko after he was found by hunters .
