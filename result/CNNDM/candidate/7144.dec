The I'm UP Alarm can be set to go off the night before and will only turn off if you scan a QR code in another room . 
  The app is set to be released in June and can be printed on a mug or a magnet . 
  The alarm will make a noise until you get out of bed to scan the code . 
  It will have a snooze function but only for a set number of times .
