Google has announced a tool that locates missing handsets by searching for the term 'find my phone' on the search engine's homepage . 
  It works with all Android phones that have the latest Google app installed and when the user is signed into their Google account on Chrome  . 
  The same Google account must be signed into on the phone . 
  A map appears and clicking 'Ring' will remotely call the handset . 
  The tool can't lock the phone or erase its data . 
  It appears to only work when you're signed into your Google account .
