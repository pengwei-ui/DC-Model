Nic Newling spent his childhood in psychiatric wards and hopping from doctor to doctor who couldn't figure out why he felt so depressed . 
 It took years of trialling medications and experiencing suicidal thoughts before he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder . 
 When his older brother committed suicide due to his own quieter battle with mental illness, Nic's life was put back into perspective . 
 He now works as a mental health advocate trying to destroy negative stigmas and encourage open and honest conversation without shame .
