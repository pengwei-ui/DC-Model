Historian Eric Cline at George Washington University says a series of disasters between 1225BC and 1177BC led to downfall of ancient societies . 
 He argues that as they all relied on each other for trade the collapse of one society created a domino effect that resulted in the start of the Dark Ages . 
 He makes the claims in his book Â 1177BC The Year Civilisation Collapsed .
