Visited Spartia in the south of Kefalonia and then Fiscardo, in the north . 
 First, from Villa Hephaestus, could see Lourdas Bay and  Zakynthos island . 
 Charming local, family-run eateries were found throughout the island . 
 Nightlife is virtually non-existent, so spent energy exploring during the day . 
 Fiscardo, once a remote fishing port, is now a world-class yachting centre .
