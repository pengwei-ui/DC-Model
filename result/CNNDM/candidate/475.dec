Lead King historian Stuart Wexler said the FBI destroyed files from a Congressional Committee set up to investigate the killing of Dr King and John F Kennedy in 1968 . 
  He said the files had information on Tommy Tarrants - a former KKK member who may have been involved in the killing . 
  The files were destroyed from field offices in Miami and Mobile in 1977 . 
  King was shot dead by James Earl Ray on 4 April 1968 in Memphis . 
  He says the FBI disobeyed a Congressional order not to destroy the files .
