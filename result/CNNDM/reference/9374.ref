15 animals escaped from a farm in Schodack in upstate New York on Thursday evening then crossed the river . 
 They safely crossed roads and made it onto the Thurway which links up the major cities in the state . 
 However authorities took the decision to gun them down because they posed a danger to the public . 
 Police say the decision was made after experts agreed tranquilizers would not be effective .
