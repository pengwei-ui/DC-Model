Reddit launched its r/thebutton thread on April Fool's Day . 
 It is accompanied by a timer that counts down from 60 seconds . 
 When The Button is clicked, the timer resets and the person who pressed it is given a colour that signifies how long they left it before pressing . 
 It is not known what will happen if the timer drops to zero .
