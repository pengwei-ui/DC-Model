Four-metre long king cobra Raja has delivered almost 500 milligrams of deadly toxin for handler Billy Collett at Gosford's Australian Reptile Park . 
  The toxin is enough to fill a shot glass and 40 times the amount of venom of a brown snake . 
  'It can kill a full grown elephant,' Mr Collett said  .
