The organizers of the protest at McGuffey High School  encouraged anyone who shared their bigoted stance to show support by wearing a flannel shirt . 
 The event was held last Thursday and students report that openly gay pupils were also physically bullied . 
 A number of the anti-gay protesters proudly shared photos of them wearing flannel shirts on social media platforms such as Instagram . 
 Thursday's event appeared to be a reaction to a Day Of Silence events for bullied LBGT students held the previous day .
