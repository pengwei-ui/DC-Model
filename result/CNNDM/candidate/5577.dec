Senators voted 19-0 to give the White House some of, but not all of its asks . 
  The bill would codify its role in processing a nuclear deal with Iran . 
  It would also give Congress the authority to approve a final deal . 
  The White House had said it would 'absolutely' veto the bill as written . 
  Senators voted to leave in a signature feature giving Congress the power to approve the deal . 
  It now goes to the full Senate where it could be vetoed .
