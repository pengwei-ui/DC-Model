L'Ardéchoise is in the stunning Ardèche region in south central France . 
  The region is famous for the world's oldest cave paintings at Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc .

  The Safari tents come with bunk beds and are more luxurious than canvas . 
  The campsite has immaculate facilities and is family friendly .
