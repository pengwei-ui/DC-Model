Colin Barnett made the comments at the launch of a new blueprint for marine science in Western Australia . 
  He said 'some good' has come out of the search for missing Malaysia Airline plane . 
  Search parties have not been successful in recovering MH370 since it disappeared on March 8 last year . 
  This comes as the wife of an Australian passenger on MH370 said she is yet to tell her children why their father hasn't come home .
