Scientists in China are said to have introduced DNA changes to reproductive cells in human embryos for the first time with gene editing technique known as CRISPR . 
  The changes are preserved in sperm and egg cells and can be passed on to future generations . 
  Researchers say the technique is 'dangerous and ethically unacceptable' But it could be used to 'select' the genes of grandchildren . 
  Scientists in the US and China are also said to be working on the technique .
