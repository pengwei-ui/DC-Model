Robert Gentile appeared in federal court on Friday and was charged with selling a firearm to an undercover agent . 
  His lawyer said the arrest was a ruse to pressure him to talk about the $500million art heist from 1990 at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum . 
  Gentile was arrested on a gun charge but denies any knowledge of the theft . 
  13 masterpieces including Rembrandt and Vermeer were stolen from the museum .
