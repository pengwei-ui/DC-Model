The aluminium battery was created at Stanford University . 
  It is said to be the first high-performance aluminium battery that is 'fast-charging, long-lasting and inexpensive' The technology is both greener and safer than current batteries . 
  It recharges in less than 60 seconds and can withstand more than 7,500 cycles . 
  But the researchers said the battery has only half the voltage of lithium-ion technology .
