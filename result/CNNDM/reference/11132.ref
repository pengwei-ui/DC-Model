Fossils of a creature bearing a striking similarity to depictions of Nessie have been found in a 19th century collection . 
 It is thought the fossil was found in Cromarty and would have once lived in a freshwater lake betweenÂ 542 million years ago to 251 million years ago . 
 Researchers have revealed that Pterichthyoides milleri - or 'Pessie' - lived on the bottom of the lakes that would later become Loch Ness .
