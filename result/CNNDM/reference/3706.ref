Inverness' Gary Warren will miss the club's first-ever Scottish Cup final . 
 Warren picked up his second yellow card of the Cup in the semi-final against Celtic and is therefore suspended for the showdown on May 30 . 
 He was also suspended for the Scottish League Cup final last season . 
 The defender believes the threshold for yellow card suspensions should be raised and is disappointed to be missing out on making history .
