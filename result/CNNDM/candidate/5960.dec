Researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California cut real skin samples and then attempted to rip them apart using X-ray beams . 
  They found the collagen in the dermis of the skin straighten and stretch in response to a tear . 
  This is to share the stress and prevent further damage to the skin . 
  The researchers found that mammalian skin has sophisticated stress resistance properties that prevent holes from growing .
