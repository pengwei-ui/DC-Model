Washington, DC-based company wants to create a new space station to replace the ISS . 
  Their giant cylinder would rotate four times per minute to create artificial gravity . 
  It would be 1,300ft (400 metres) long, cost £200 billion ($300 billion) and take 30 years to build . 
  The ‘space mushroom’ was designed by Bill Kemp and Ted Maziejka from United Space Structures . 
  Artificial gravity is created by spinning the station 4 . 
 22 times a minute . 
  This would allow people to live in ‘zero-gravity’ on Earth .
