Apple is rumoured to be using the same 7000 series aluminium as its forthcoming Apple Watch Sport edition . 
  The material would make the next iPhone 60 per cent harder than the iPhone 6 . 
  It is the same as that used to make racing bikes but has been altered to make it lighter . 
  iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus can be bent out of shape when placed in a pocket .
