National Grid has revealed the UK’s first new pylon for nearly 90 years . 
  Called the T-pylon it is a third shorter than the old lattice pylons . 
  But it is able to carry just as much power - 400,000 volts . 
  It is designed to be less obtrusive and will be used for clean energy purposes . 
  National Grid is building a training line of the less obtrusive towers at their training academy in Nottinghamshire .
