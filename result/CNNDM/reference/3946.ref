Doctors found Jackson Byrnes' aggressive brain tumour three weeks ago . 
 Only one surgeon in Australia, Dr Charlie Teo, was willing to operate . 
 More than $95,000 was raised for Jackson by strangers to pay for the $80,000 surgery and help fund his treatment . 
 It was expected Jackson would wake paralysed from the extremely risky op . 
 Instead, he woke up and moved his arms, head and thanked Dr Teo . 
 It's hoped the operation has bought him more time .
