Biologists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel used high speed videos of octopuses crawling over objects to study how the animals move . 
 Rather than pulling themselves along they use their legs to push instead . 
 They can move in one direction while their bodies face a different direction . 
 The findings could help scientists develop new types of rescue robots .
