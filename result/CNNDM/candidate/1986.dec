Casey Veal's son Zayden was just 10 months old when he was bludgeoned to death by a drug-crazed burglar . 
  Harley Hicks broke into their Bendigo home at random in June 2012 . 
  He bashed the baby more than 30 times with a homemade baton . 
  The crime was fuelled by ice and marijuana . 
  'My son was murdered so he could get a hit of ice . 
  That's it,' Ms Veal told 60 Minutes .
