Amanda Butler had a normal pregnancy until her waters broke at 25 weeks . 
  Her son Callum was born weighing just 1lb 9oz and doctors feared he would not survive . 
  She was later told her premature labour was triggered by a common infection called bacterial vaginosis (BV) BV affects one in three women and is twice as common as thrush . 
  It occurs when the balance of internal bacteria is disrupted and can also cause miscarriage . 
  Mrs Butler had never heard of BV before her son was born . 
  She has urged other women to be aware of the condition .
