Stuart Broad has seen his place in the England side questioned . 
  The 28-year-old was dismissed for a duck in the first Test against West Indies in Antigua . 
  Broad has taken 63 wickets in the last 14 Tests but must not be confused with the batsman . 
  He has lost all confidence in his batting but he still produces with the ball .
