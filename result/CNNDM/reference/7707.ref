Tianwen Chen and wife found a baby girl in a box by the road in 1989 . 
 They carried her home, even though they had little money to live off . 
 Since then they have adopted more and more disabled children . 
 Sadly nine of the children died and the couple soon used up their savings . 
 Donations from the public mean they now have a brand new home .
