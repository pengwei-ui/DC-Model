It was claimed Sunday that the Food Network star has been cheating on his wife with assistant Elyse Tirrell for three years . 
 Flay's business partner Lawrence Kretchmar dismissed the report, saying he'd have known if the chef was having an affair with an employee . 
 Tirrell, who is 28, used to work as a hostess at one of Flay's restaurants before being promoted to be his assistant . 
 The celebrity chef has filed for divorce from March, 40, after 10 years of marriage but she is contesting their prenup .
