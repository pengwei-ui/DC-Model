President Obama reportedly granted CIA a waiver exempting the agency from providing proof of imminent threat to the US ahead of planned drone strikes in January . 
  Dr Warren Weinstein and Italian aid worker Giovanni Lo Porto were killed in a botched drone strike in Pakistan . 
  US officials say the waiver was granted after Obama enacted more stringent rules in 2013 to reduce civilian casualties . 
  The CIA was not required to provide proof that intended targets posed an imminent threat . 
  The waiver could have prevented the January 15 strike that killed the two hostages .
