Research led by the New Jersey Institute of Technology has revealed the first high-resolution footage of a solar flux 'rope' taking shape on the sun . 
  In the video, twisting groups of magnetic fields can be seen writhing around . 
  The rope is thought to be the main cause of solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) Solar flux ropes are common structures in the solar corona . 
  They are essentially twisted bundles of magnetic field that extend out of and back into the surface . 
  The new footage was revealed in a paper led by Dr Haimin Wang .
