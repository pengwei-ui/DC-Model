Aaron Jones and Jamie Toms used scrap wood and insulation board to build the boat . 
  The pair spent just Â£9 on silicone glue to hold the 6ft vessel together . 
  But an oar snapped 200 yards off Jaywick, Essex and they had to be rescued by a lifeboat crew . 
  Neither man was wearing a lifejacket and one was unable to swim .
