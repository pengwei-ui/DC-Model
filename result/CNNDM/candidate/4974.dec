Josh Darnbrough awoke after a party to find his friend Rob Gaskell had tattooed his back with a DIY kit . 
  Rob said he was taking revenge on Josh for a tattoo he did on his leg two years ago . 
  Josh had attempted to tattoo the words 'If found face down call an ambulance' on his back - but it went horribly wrong . 
  The pair are having their tattoos removed by a laser technician .
