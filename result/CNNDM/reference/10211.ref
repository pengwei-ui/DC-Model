Anthony Joshua will take on Jason Gavern in Newcastle on Saturday . 
 Joshua will be entering the ring for the first time in 2015 after recovering from a stress fracture in his back . 
 This will be Joshua's 11th professional bout since his debut in 2013 . 
 He believes that his 'hunger and determination' will more than make up for Gavern's superior experience of 50 fights .
