An unnamed Wall Street trader made a profit of approximately $2.5million on Friday thanks to a tweet from the Wall Street Journal . 
 The trader purchased 315,800 shares of chipmaker Altera one minute after the Journal reported Intel was in talks to purchase them . 
 The shares were sold to the trader at $36, and just 28 minutes later, when the market closed, shares were selling for $44.39 . 
 Intel's reported purchase of Altera still has yet to happen, and the news has actually caused the price of Intel shares to fall .
