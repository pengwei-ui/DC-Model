Nigel Farage called for a cap on net migration to be limited at 50,000 a year . 
  But he said overall caps would be ‘ludicrous’ because it was impossible to stop people leaving the country . 
  Ukip’s manifesto chief said the limit ‘might change every year’ The Conservatives accused Mr Farage of ‘making up his policies as he goes along’ But Mr Farage has denied his party has made any U-turns on immigration .
