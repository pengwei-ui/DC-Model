Wisden editor Lawrence Booth has launched a stinging attack on English cricket . 
  He says the national team have lost touch with the public . 
  England also come under fire for their handling of Kevin Pietersen and Alastair Cook . 
  Booth says the ECB's decision to sack Cook so late made little sense .
