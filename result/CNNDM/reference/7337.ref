Historian Dr Mary Ann Lund believes Richard III used good tailoring and clever armour to hide the scoliosis in his spine that curved to the right . 
 She argues his condition only emerged when he was stripped after death . 
 Scientists who examined Richard III's skeleton say the king was far from being the hunchback portrayed by William Shakespeare in his plays . 
 Dr Lund says the king's name was probably blackened after death in battle .
