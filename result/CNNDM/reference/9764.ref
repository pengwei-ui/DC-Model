A Romanian woman being deported from New Zealand after relationship broke down, has been told she must leave her 2-year-old son behind . 
 Immigration told Nicole Mihai to return Romania as she is not a NZ citizen . 
 Family Court ruled she cannot take son more then 50 kms from his father . 
 The 34-year-old has full custody of her son with his father out of the picture . 
 Ms Mihai is now undergoing a long battle with Immigration Agency who insist that her son's living arrangements 'are not their problem'
