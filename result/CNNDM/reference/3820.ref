Sean Crawford has been criticised for using dead animals in his sculptures . 
 His interest in taxidermy started through hunting on his farm as a child . 
 All the animals used were killed in New Zealand as a part of pest control . 
 His work is currently on display at Traffic Jam Galleries in Neutral Bay . 
 Museum curators said his work is being received well in Australia .
