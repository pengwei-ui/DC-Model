England captain Alastair Cook has been working on a new batting stance . 
 His new stance has his front foot too far out without protecting the wicket . 
 As a result, he doesn't have time to adjust to the delivery and set himself . 
 Cook probably overdid his new stance against the West Indies . 
 Still, he shouldn't be written off just yet and impressed in training .
