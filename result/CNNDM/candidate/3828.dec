Robert Clark spent his Â£50,000 life savings on home care for the past two years . 
  He is one of Britain's oldest surviving prisoner of war soldiers . 
  Brent Council said it could not afford to pay for a live-in carer to stay with him . 
  Mr Clark is blind, deaf in one ear and dependent on a wheelchair . 
  Help for Heroes has given him an emergency grant so he can remain at home . 
  But the council wants him to move into a care home because it is cheaper . 
  Charity has launched a fundraising drive to keep Mr Clark in his own home .
