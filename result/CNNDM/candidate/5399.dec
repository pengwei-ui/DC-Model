Bogan Shire Council wants to erect a 'big bogan' statue in the town of Nyngan . 
  Graeme Burke has designed a 3 . 
 6m tall steel sculpture of a 'bloke' in a singlet with a fishing rod . 
  The statue would be on the banks of the Bogan River and tourists would be able to sit on it . 
  The 'Big Bogan' could be as popular as the Big Banana in Coffs Harbour and the Big Prawn in Ballina .
