Slovenian-born Aljaz Bedene secured a British passport last month . 
 International Tennis Federation ruled Bedene can't play for Great Britain . 
 Ruling comes after Bedene played twice for Slovenia in 2010 and 2011 . 
 Rusedski, who switched to Britain from Canada, offered his support . 
 Bedene's world No 99 ranking puts him only behind Andy Murray in Britain . 
 Murray backed Bedene's switch saying it would motivate those below him .
