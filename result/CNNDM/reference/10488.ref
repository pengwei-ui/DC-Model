Washington, DC company United Space Structures wants to create a new space station . 
 It rotates four times a minute to create artificial gravity - with the 'stem' and 'dome spinning in opposite directions . 
 It would be 1,300ft (400 metres) long, cost £200 billion ($300 billion) and take 30 years to build . 
 ‘We believe artificial gravity is required to support long term living in space,’ Bill Kemp from USS told MailOnline .
