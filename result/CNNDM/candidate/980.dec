John O'Connor was head of Scotland Yard's Flying Squad at the time of the heist . 
  He said the fire in Holborn could be linked to the Hatton Garden raid . 
  The fire started just 500 metres from where the thieves broke into the vault . 
  Former police officer said it was 'too much of a coincidence' to be a coincidence . 
  The gang broke into a vault at the bank over the Easter weekend . 
  It came just days after firefighters battled a fire in the same area .
