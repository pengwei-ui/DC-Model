David Curry was asked to leave The Wallow pub in Blyth, Northumberland . 
  He was wearing a pair of Â£40 Adidas trousers for breakfast with his wife and stepdaughter . 
  Mr Curry was told he could not order a drink because he was wearing tracksuit bottoms . 
  The pub chain has apologised but said a no-tracksuit policy had been in place at the bar since 2013 .
