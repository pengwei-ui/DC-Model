Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott should both play all three Tests against West Indies . 
  Cook has failed to score a century in his last 61 Test innings for England . 
  Trott was dismissed for just four runs on day three of the first Test in Antigua . 
  The pair should both be given a chance to prove themselves against the Windies . 
  Cook and Trott have both been criticised for their poor form .
