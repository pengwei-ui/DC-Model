Lawrencium was discovered by nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence in 1961 . 
  It currently sits at the bottom of a group of rare radioactive elements known as the actinides . 
  Scientists have measured the ionisation potential of lawrencium for the first time . 
  The element currently sits in a separate block from the main table . 
  But new research suggests it has properties similar to sodium and potassium . 
  This means it should be placed in the 'd-block' of the periodic table .
