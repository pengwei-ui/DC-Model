Belinda Bartholomew claims she was racially abused at a Bondi butcher . 
 The girlfriend of Sydney Roosters star Aidan Guerra went to buy a chicken for a Game of Thrones inspired dinner . 
 She says she was sworn at and told to 'go to a f***ing Aussie butcher' when she tried to change her chicken selection . 
 The butcher vehemently denies he was rude to or swore at her and says the woman is a 'troublemaker' out to ruin the business .
