Austin Carey and Jay Rawe were involved in near-fatal base jump last year . 
 The jump from Perrine Bridge went wrong and the pair spiraled 500ft down . 
 Men suffered fractured vertebrae and Mr Carey was told he may never walk again because of the severity of his injuries from the jump . 
 Both miraculously recovered and have returned to the sport - Mr Carey back to the site of the near-fatal jump almost a year after the accident .
