Lord Greville Janner is accused of molesting young boys in children's homes in the 1970s and 1980s . 
  Prosecutors say there is 'overwhelming cause' to charge him with 22 sex attacks on nine victims . 
  But he will not face child abuse charges because of his dementia and memory problems . 
  His alleged victims could bring civil claims against him and each could claim up to Â£100,000 . 
  Legal firm Slater & Gordon is considering having him examined by experts to prove he has dementia . 
  The Labour peer has been accused of sexually assaulting boys in care homes . 
  Director of public prosecutions said his dementia made him unfit to face trial .
