Rex Cinema in Berkhamsted has cancelled the regular Tuesday baby matinees due to 'whingeing, bitching, snitching and the law' Manager James Hannaway restored and reopened the traditional cinema in 2004 . 
  He said he was fed up with clearing away dirty nappies and oversized prams . 
  The special screenings were introduced in 2007 after complaints over babies being allowed to watch adult films .
