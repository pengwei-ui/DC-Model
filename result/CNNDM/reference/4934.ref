April Morris of South Carolina, thought she'd never see her beloved pit bull, Nina Louise, again after she went astray in December 2013 . 
 But this past Saturday she couldn't believe her eyes when she saw footage of the malnourished pup's heartbreaking rescue on the nightly news . 
 Morris called the local Humane Society to claim the pit bull and identified her by detailing two white spots in the fur behind her head . 
 She collected the dog and her ten puppies .
