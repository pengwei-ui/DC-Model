A contestant called Tom left a lasting impression with viewers for all the wrong reasons on Friday night . 
 Host Alex Trebek asked: 'In common law, the age of this, signaling adulthood, is presumed to be 14 in boys & 12 in girls?'The first contestant to press his buzzer was Tom who inexplicably answered: 'What is the age of consent?'The correct answer was puberty and Tom's inappropiate reply left him trending on Twitter .
