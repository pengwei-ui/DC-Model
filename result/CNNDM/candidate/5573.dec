Boris Majnaric of South Jordan built the 384-sq-ft bird house in 1996 and went on to rear more than 200 pigeons - five times over the legal limit . 
  Neighbors complained about the pigeons and the city council decided to tear down the aviary . 
  The 75-year-old spent more than $40,000 fighting the city in court . 
  The aviary was finally demolished last Tuesday .
