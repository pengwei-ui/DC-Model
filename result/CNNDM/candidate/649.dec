Cathleen Hackney is on trial at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court in relation to the cremation of her son Paul Moreland . 
  Hackney allegedly told two different funeral directors that there were no objections to her son being cremated after his death . 
  She is said to have deliberately 'pressed ahead' with the plans despite knowing her ex-husband Paul Barber would have objected . 
  The 56-year-old denies making a false representation and signing false certificates . 
  Mr Moreland was cremated in December 2010 without his father's knowledge .
