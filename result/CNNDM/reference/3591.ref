The seesaw was created by talented Temecula-based carpenter Kyle Toth . 
 Kyle placed the large trunk into natural split of tree and cut it down to size . 
 Rope attached to one side of the seesaw helps people get on and off . 
 Seesaw is made from raw material and sends occupiers toÂ height of  25ft .
