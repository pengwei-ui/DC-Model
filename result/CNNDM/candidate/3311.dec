Gaby Tillero and Greg Ensslen bought the two-story 1840s Creole home from a church in the Central City neighborhood of New Orleans almost two years ago . 
  The couple dismantled the home and moved it to the Freret neighborhood . 
  They then spent seven months renovating the home while respecting the original floor plan . 
  The home is decorated with materials salvaged from other homes and salvage markets .
