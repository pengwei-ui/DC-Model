Spanish national Mar√≠a Jose Carrascosa, 49, was jailed in 2006 after refusing to return her daughter to the custody of her father in New Jersey . 
 She was released Friday, in part because her estranged ex Peter Innes wrote a letter asking the court to do what's best for their daughter, now 14 . 
 Carrascosa, now the focus of widespread media attention in Spain, plans to return to Valencia as soon as possible to be with her daughter . 
 The two have already had a tearful reunion after Carrascosa's release via Skype .
