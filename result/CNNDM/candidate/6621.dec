Chipotle says it does not know when it will have enough pork for its carnitas burritos . 
  The fast-casual chain removed carnitas pork from a third of its stores in January . 
  It only uses humanely-raised pigs that have not received added hormones . 
  Fewer than five per cent of pigs in the US are raised to Chipotle standards . 
  The pork shoulder meat comes from pigs raised outside or in living spaces with straw .
