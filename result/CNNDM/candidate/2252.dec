Kezzia French thought she had buried her daughter Andrea to rest in 1999 after she was killed by her father Meyrick Fowler . 
  The six-month-old died after being flung at a wall by the lottery addict . 
  But police failed to tell Ms French she was burying her daughter with vital organs missing . 
  She only found out in 2012 that police had retained her liver, spine, bowel, kidneys and skull fragments . 
  Police also admitted her brain had been cremated in 2009 . 
  Ms French will hold a second funeral for Andrea tomorrow in Suffolk .
