Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has ordered officials to start 'mapping the pressures' on the state schools system . 
  She told Ofsted it was not 'helpful' to warn of an 'influx' of migrants in schools . 
  Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw last year warned of the impact on schools . 
  Education Secretary said she has asked the Department for Education to examine the impact of migrants . 
  Net migration hit 298,000 in the year to September 2014 .
