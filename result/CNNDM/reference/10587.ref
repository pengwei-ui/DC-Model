Arizona police chief Terry Rozema has voiced his support for his officer after dashcam footage emerged . 
 Officer Michael Rapiejko is seen mounting a sidewalk in his speeding police car and knocking down armed suspect Mario Valencia . 
 Pozema argued that Rapiejko may actually have saved Valencia's life because we don't know what he would have done next . 
 'We don't know that if (Rapiejko) lets him go for another 10 seconds, (Valencia) doesn't take somebody out in the parking lot,' Rozema said .
