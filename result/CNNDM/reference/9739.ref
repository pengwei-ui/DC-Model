Tommy Cox from Colchester looks just like Prince George of Cambridge . 
 Both two-year-olds have the same rosy cheeks and a similar hairstyle . 
 Even Tommy's mother - who is also called Kate - thinks they look alike . 
 While he looks like George, Tommy's mother admits her son’s behaviour sometimes falls rather short of regal .
