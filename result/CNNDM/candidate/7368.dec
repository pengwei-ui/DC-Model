Jane Laut was arrested in 2009 for the murder of her Olympic medalist husband David Laut . 
  Prosecutors dropped the charges and then refiled them on Friday in a Ventura County courtroom . 
  The move is an apparent attempt to delay the trial of 57-year-old Laut in the 2009 killing of her husband . 
  Laut claims she shot her husband in self-defense after he killed their son and dogs . 
  Her husband won a bronze medal in the 1984 Olympics . 
  He was shot several times in the head outside their California home .
