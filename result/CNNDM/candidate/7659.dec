Sir Bruce Forsyth said it can be 'more cruel to do nothing' than to let someone die . 
  He said he wants to 'die with a bit of dignity left' after watching first wife Penny Calvert suffer with dementia . 
  The entertainer helped nurse her until she died in a care home last year . 
  Sir Bruce said people should not be 'left to suffer' and called for assisted dying to be legalised .
