Glen Walford has been embroiled in a legal battle with Worcestershire County Council since her mother Mary moved to a care home in 2006 . 
  Theatre director said she intended to retire to the £205,000 house in Stourport-upon-Severn . 
  Council said her home should not be used to recover cost of her mother’s care . 
  Judge ruled in favour of council and said house was not her home at the time her mother went into care because she rents a flat in London .
