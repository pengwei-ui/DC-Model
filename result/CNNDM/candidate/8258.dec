Two swimmers were swimming in the shallows off Destin, Florida when a giant hammerhead shark chased a fish . 
  The men were shouted at to get out of the water by a group of men on a penthouse balcony  . 
  Hammerheads are largely harmless to humans but the swimmers did not believe the shark was dangerous .
