British scientists spent almost 18 years developing the robotic 'chef' hands . 
  The Â£10,000 ($14,000) device will be sold from as early as 2017 as part of a high-tech kitchen . 
  The hands are governed by 24 motors, 26 micro-controllers and 129 sensors . 
  They can chop, stir, whisk and baste well enough to recreate almost anything .
