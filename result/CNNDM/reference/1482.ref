Marie Surprenant, from Atlanta, Georgia, was left paraplegic after being severely abused as an infant . 
 When Marie was eight-months-old she was admitted to the emergency room with more than 14 fractures, weighing only 14lbs . 
 After social workers investigated her case, she was put into foster care and adopted byÂ Michele Surprenant . 
 Michele, who is also a social worker, says it was her adoptive daughter's idea to write the letter because she is grateful for her new home .
