Alondra Luna Nunez was taken from her parents in Guanajuato by police working for Interpol last week . 
  Dorotea Garcia believed she was her long-lost daughter who was illegally taken to Mexico by her father in 2007 at age four . 
  Alondra was taken to Houston where a judge ignored her parents' pleas and sent her to live with Garcia . 
  A DNA test proved she was not the daughter of Houston resident Garcia . 
  She was returned to her parents on Wednesday .
