Inca kingdom in the Andes was connected via handwoven rope bridges . 
 Today, only one bridge remains - the Keshwa Chaca near Huinchiri, Peru . 
 The 90ft-long bridge is rebuilt by villagers over three days every June, before gradually disintegrating each time . 
 Locals use the same techniques to make the rope as their Inca ancestors .
