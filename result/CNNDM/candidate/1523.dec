National Union of Teachers (NUT) to call for 'play in the curriculum' for five to seven-year-olds . 
  Teachers want children to have more play time to encourage communication and social skills . 
  They want the UK to follow the lead of countries such as Finland which has 15 minute play time after lessons . 
  NUT says many children are not ready to sit down and do reading, writing and maths at the age of four or five . 
  It will say schools should introduce 45-minute lessons and 15-minute play times .
