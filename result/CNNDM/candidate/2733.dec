Sylvia Freedman filmed the disturbing scene at Avoca Beach in the Central Coast on Tuesday . 
  The beach in the north of NSW was covered in yellow foam that stretched for more than 15 metres . 
  She was enjoying a family trip away at the beach when the power went out . 
  'The foam just felt like you were in a snow globe,' she said  . 
  The beach is about 95kms north of Sydney and is on the NSW Central Coast .
