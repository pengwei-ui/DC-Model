As California struggles with a devastating drought, huge amounts of water are mysteriously vanishing from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta . 
 The prime suspects are farmers whose families have tilled fertile soil there for generations . 
 Delta farmers say they're not stealing it because their history of living at the water's edge gives them that right . 
 California's  water rights system has historically given senior water rights holders the ability to use as much water as they need, even in drought . 
 Gov. Jerry Brown has said that if drought continues this system built into California's legal framework could be changed .
