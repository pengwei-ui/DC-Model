An Egyptian goose that lived for at least a week with an arrow piercing its neck died after surgery . 
 The goose at first appeared to make it successfully through the operation at a bird and wildlife clinic Wednesday but then died a short time later . 
 'The vet did everything that they could do,' said Katie Ingram of Orange County Animal Care . 
 The cause of injury is likely a victim of animal cruelty .
