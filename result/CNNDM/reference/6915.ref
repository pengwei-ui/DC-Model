Adrian Langlais died on March 19, the day after his second birthday, from head injuries allegedly caused by his mother's boyfriend Christian Tyrrell . 
 The toddler's adoptive grandparents say they started noticing bruises on the boy in November, when mother Jessica Langlais started dating Tyrrell . 
 They say Jessica ignored their warnings, and that Child Protective Services cleared Tyrrell of any wrong doing a month before Adrian's death . 
 Tyrrell was arrested Wednesday on capital murder charges and is being held on $1million bond .
