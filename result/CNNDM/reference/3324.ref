Khloe Kardashian posted a photo to Instagram during Monday night's riots that said: 'Pray for Baltimore'Despite getting over 400,000 likes, the post drew criticism that she was insincere and unable to relate to the issues due to her privileged background . 
 Other critics felt she should focus her prayers elsewhere, such as the victims of the Nepal earthquake . 
 Just 30 minutes later she tweeted that she was: 'Damned if I do. Damned if I don't', and asked: 'Now it's wrong to pray?'The Instagram post has since been deleted
