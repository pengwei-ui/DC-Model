More than 200 mummified bodies were found in a hidden crypt of the Dominican church in the city of Vác in Hungary during restoration work . 
 Geneticists led by scientists at the University of Warwick studied samples from 26 of the bodies and found that eight of them had died of tuberculosis . 
 They discovered DNA of 14 different strains of TB bacteria  in the mummies . 
 Analysis showed the strains all descended from a single strain that begun causing infections during the late Roman empire between 396CE-470CE .
