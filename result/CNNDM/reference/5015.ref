Zoo Weekly came under fire for their scandalous Anzac Day issue . 
 The front cover featured a half-naked model holding a red poppy . 
 The Department of Veteran Affairs said Zoo could not use the word Anzac . 
 The word can't be used without permission for commercial purposes . 
 Social media users condemned the 'gross and offensive' issue . 
 Zoo Weekly has since removed all offending images from their websites .
