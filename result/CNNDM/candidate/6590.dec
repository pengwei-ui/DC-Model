Photographs were shot by Linden Gledhill from Staffordshire . 
  The 51-year-old uses a modified microscope and a camera to capture the finer details of a butterflyâ€™s wing . 
  They show the layout of individual scales which give the insect its iridescence . 
  Butterfly wings are covered by thousands of microscopic scales . 
  Some of the scales look like exotic bird feathers and others are rainbow-coloured .
