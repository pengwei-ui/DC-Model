Lady Sasima Srivikorn and Sir John Madejski are co-owners of Reading . 
 They are preparing to take the club to Wembley on Saturday night; Reading's first FA Cup semi-final since 1927 . 
 Lady Sasima is something of an eccentric - she is a singer and composer who, in September, had '100 bullets from an M16' shot at her house . 
 The pair have a long-term ambition to take Reading to the Premier League .
