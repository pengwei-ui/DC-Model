Carlisle slumped to a 3-1 defeat away at Accrington Stanley . 
 The team's poor performance prompted a scathing assessment from manager Keith Curle who suggested some of his squad were not fit for purpose . 
 Carlisle are without a win in five games in League Two and just two places above the relegation zone . 
 The Cumbrians were relegated from League One last season and are at a serious risk of dropping out of the Football League entirely this term .
