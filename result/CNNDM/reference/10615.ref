An attorney for at least one of the officers, Michael Davey, said Thursday that Gray was not strapped in during transport . 
 The 25-year-old was cuffed at the wrists and shackled at the ankles - he was found to have a fatal spine injury, but the cause remains unknown . 
 'Nickel rides'  have caused spinal injuries in the past. Another Baltimore man, Dondi Johnson, was killed by such a ride in 2005 . 
 Department rules were updated nine days before Gray's arrest stating that all detainees shall be strapped in by seat belts or other device .
