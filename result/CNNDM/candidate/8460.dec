During a question and answer session at the White House for their annual Take our Daughter's and Son's to Work Day a little girl named Anya Brodie asked Michelle Obama her age . 
  'I'm 51,' replied Michelle Obama . 
  The girl yelled in amazement , 'You look too young!' Michelle Obama was so flattered by the compliment that she called her up on stage to give her a hug .
