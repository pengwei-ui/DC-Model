Researchers at the University of Huddersfield have created a technique which can distinguish between the genetic fingerprints of identical twins . 
  Identical twins share 100 per cent of their genes . 
  But as they age different life experiences create variations in the number of hydrogen bonds in the DNA . 
  Using a technique called high resolution melt curve analysis - or HRMA - researchers can identify the difference between each twin . 
  Method is based on heating DNA until its bonds break .
