The alarm system at the former president's Houston property failed around September 2013 but was not replaced until December 2014 . 
 It came after an agent recommended in 2010 that the 20-year system be replaced but the request was denied . 
 The details emerged in a report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General released on Thursday . 
 The report recommended that the agency reviews all security equipment .
