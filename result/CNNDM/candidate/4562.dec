Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his Â£2 million flat to his daughters and son in March last year . 
  He was able to do this despite his legal team claiming he was unfit to stand trial . 
  The flat was transferred in the same month police raided his Westminster office . 
  It puts the luxury apartment out of reach for potential child abuse victims suing the peer for compensation .
