Donna Oettinger and her son Zaki died on train tracks in south London in March 2013 . 
  She had sought urgent psychiatric help in the months before the tragedy but was unable to receive treatment recommended by doctors . 
  Her mental health had declined after discovering Zaki's father had a second family in Egypt . 
  Doctors and social services in charge of her made five 'significant' failures . 
  But coroner said 'nothing could have be done' to foresee the deaths .
