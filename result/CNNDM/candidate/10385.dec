The ‘Antarctic BW29 signal was recorded near the Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands and Antarctic Peninsula . 
  It doesn’t fit the pattern of noise made by Arnoux's beaked whales or Cuvier’s beaked whale . 
  The noise could belong to a strap-toothed whale, a southern bottlenosed whale or a Gray’S beaked Whale . 
  Scientists at the University of California recorded the noise more than 1,000 times . 
  It is unique in the composition of the noise and in timing . 
  This suggests the noise is from a new species of beaked mammal .
