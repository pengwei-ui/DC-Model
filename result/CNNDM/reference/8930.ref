Leo Grand was offered a deal: either $100 or lessons in coding from Patrick McConlogue, who passed him on the street every day . 
 After daily coding lessons Grand launched carpooling app Trees for Cars . 
 Grand said he made $15,000 from the app, which is no longer in stores because he does not want to pay for the server space . 
 He said he hasn't found the time to code every day anymore . 
 Grand insists he likes living outdoors, but said he should have come up with an idea that made more money .
