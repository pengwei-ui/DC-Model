Researchers at Stanford University School of Medicine believe the antibody injection could 'wipe out cancer' by rooting out and eradicating primary tumours and distant metastases . 
  The lab-engineered antibodies could be trained to attack melanoma, pancreatic, breast and lung cancer . 
  They injected the antibodies into mice and the mice were cancer-free for a year . 
  The process could eradicate not only tumours but metastases that have spread through the body . 
  Their findings have been hailed a 'tour de force'
