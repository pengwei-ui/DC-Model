Developers in Boston have worked with global emergency response teams to create its One-Touch-911 app . 
  Users can call the police, fire service or seek medical help at the press of a button . 
  Each of the four buttons on the app trigger a standard call to nearby dispatchers . 
  Call is placed with the phone's GPS location, user details and any pre-entered medical information . 
  The app can be used in 135 countries and is compatible with any three-digit emergency number . 
  RapidSOS will begin testing the software in Texas next month and launch the app globally .
