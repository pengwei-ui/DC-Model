Greenstone acts like a beacon to help messages move around so-called wireless mesh networks . 
  It takes advantage of a tool used by Apple for AirDrop . 
  Appleâ€™s FireChat app lets you send messages even when there is no mobile signal . 
  The egg-shaped gadget is designed to be used in a wireless mesh network . 
  Developers at Open Garden have built Greenstone to make these off-the-grid networks stronger . 
  It has a range of around 20ft (6 metres) and works with FireChat .
