The former milking parlour on Mayfair's Farm Street has four bedrooms, an indoor swimming pool and roof terrace . 
 It was once the site of a dairy where farmers housed cows for milking on the busy central London market street . 
 The original property was knocked down and replaced with the plush, modern mansion four years ago .
