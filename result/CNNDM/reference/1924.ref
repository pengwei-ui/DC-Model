George Gittoes was awarded the Sydney Peace Prize on Saturday . 
 It was in recognition of his 45 years chronicling conflicts around the world . 
 The Australian artist did this through painting, photography and film . 
 The 65-year-old will receive the prize at a November ceremony in Sydney . 
 Gittoes says he doesn't consider himself in the same league as previous winners such as Desmond Tutu and Noam Chomsky .
