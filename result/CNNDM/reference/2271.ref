Photographers in the UK captured the Lyrid meteor shower in the sky last night . 
 It occurs every year around 16 to 25 April, so you can still catch some meteors tonight and tomorrow . 
 The strength of the showers vary from year to year and most years there are no more than 20 meteors an hour . 
 But in 1982 Americans counted nearly 100 an hour and in 1803 it was as high as 700 an hour .
