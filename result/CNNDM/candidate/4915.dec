Peter wrote a letter to the First Lady saying that public school children can't live on one ketchup packet at lunch . 
  He also criticizes her for America's lack of troops in the Middle East and in the Ukraine . 
  Peter's father said the letter took six months to write because he was 'too angry' to write it all in one sitting .
