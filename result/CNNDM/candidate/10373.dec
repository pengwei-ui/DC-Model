New York City Human Rights Commission says there is enough evidence of age discrimination to hold a hearing on the gym in Stonehenge Village . 
  The gym was opened in the building last year but only rent-stabilized tenants were allowed access . 
  The rent-regulated tenants are largely over 65 while market-rate tenants pay $3,500-a-month for a one bedroom . 
  Jean Green Dorsey says the refusal 'smacks of second-class citizenship'
