Koby Hodder was playing British Bulldog on his break when he collapsed . 
 He suffered a series of cardiac arrests and was treated in intensive care . 
 Was fitted with a device to shock his heart back into beating if it stopped . 
 Now can only carry out light exercise but feels 'lucky to be alive'
