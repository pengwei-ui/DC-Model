ISIS militants entered the Yarmouk camp as Jordan closed its only functioning border crossing with the country following heavy clashes on the Syrian side between rebels and government forces . 
  Militants reportedly entered the camp from the nearby Hajar Aswad neighborhood in southern Damascus in a coordinated attack with rivals in the Al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front . 
  ISIS managed to take control of large parts of the camp following clashes with a Palestinian group . 
  The Palestinian-run refugee camp has been under government siege for nearly two years .
