Andrea Catherwood stayed at the modern masterpiece Hotel Arts . 
 Dined in the hotel's two Michelin-starred flagship restaurant, Enoteca . 
 Drank  Miraval Rosé from Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's estate in Provence . 
 Of all the stunning buildings, the one I'm drawn to is Gaudi's Casa Batllo . 
 A great city to get lost in with some of the best sights not in tourist guides .
