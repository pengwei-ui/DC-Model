Researchers based at different institutions in Tokyo noted that rats flatten their ears, narrow their eyes and puff up their cheeks when they are in pain . 
  They took photographs of rats who were in pain and others with neutral expressions . 
  To test the rodents’ response to rats’ pained expressions, they showed them the photos in a specially made cage . 
  They found that rats spent less time in the room showing rodents in pain, than they did with the photos of neutral rats . 
  The study suggests that the pained faces of rats may have a ‘communicative function’ They may even use expressions to warn other rats of danger or ask for help .
