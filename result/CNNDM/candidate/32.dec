Researchers at the University of Bath and Yale University created a molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel . 
  Hydrogen-fuel is appealing for use in cars but producing it requires huge amounts of energy . 
  The new catalyst is more efficient at producing hydrogen from water . 
  It could be used to store energy from renewable sources like solar .
