Paula McKay has won Â£13 million compensation for her daughter Natasha and son Patrick . 
  Natasha was left brain damaged and with cerebral palsy after being starved of oxygen at birth at the former Sharoe Green Hospital in Preston . 
  She was delivered at the same hospital when she was pregnant with her second child . 
  Staff at the hospital failed to recognise Natasha was in distress in the womb . 
  Patrick was also left brain-damaged after being delivered at same hospital . 
  Ms McKay has fought for 20 years to secure compensation .
