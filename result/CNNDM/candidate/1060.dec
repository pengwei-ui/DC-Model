Scientists in California have described how to create artificial auroras on Earth . 
  They said a particle accelerator could be sent 185 miles (300km) up into space . 
  It would then fire high-energy beams back at Earthâ€™s atmosphere  . 
  The beam could even create lightning in the atmosphere . 
  The accelerator would be located in space and would fire back towards Earth's atmosphere . 
  Auroras occur when electrons from the sun collide with atoms of oxygen and nitrogen .
