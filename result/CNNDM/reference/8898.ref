Gold Coast training queen Ashy Bines has apologised to her 'very upset followers' after error . 
 In an email on Saturday, she mistakenly wrote that a new exclusive program cost $US49,500 per year . 
 The real cost of the program was actually a tenth of that, or $US4,950.00, according to Ms Bines . 
 The exclusive, year-long program has now sold out, a spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia .
