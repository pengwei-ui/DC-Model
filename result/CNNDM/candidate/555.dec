Chernae Noonan founded eyebrow shaping business The Brow Bar in 2003 . 
  She has blocked BeneFit Cosmetics from using the term 'Brow Bar' exclusively in Australia . 
  BeneFit is owned by Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH), which is run by the world's 13th richest billionaire Bernard Arnault . 
  The cosmetic giant applied to trademark the phrase in Australia in 2011 . 
  Ms Noonan said customers would confuse her business with the cosmetic giant . 
  She founded the eyebrow shaping firm in 2003 and has six stores across Australia . 
  The Australian Trade Marks Office ruled in her favour .
