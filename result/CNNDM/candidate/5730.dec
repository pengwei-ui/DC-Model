Scientists are working towards digitally recreating the cognitive abilities of the Apis Mellifera or European Honeybee . 
  The artificial brain is being created by the Green Brain Project at the University of Sheffield . 
  Their final aim is to build a robot that thinks, senses and acts just like a honeybee . 
  Professor James Marshall said if they could recreate a fraction of the bee's abilities they would have made 'tremendous advances'
