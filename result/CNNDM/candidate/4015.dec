Scientist Fergus Simpson from University of Barcelona has calculated the minimum size needed for intelligent life to survive . 
  He applied a mathematical formula to assume aliens obey the same laws of conservation of energy as animals on Earth . 
  And from this he believes intelligent aliens typically weigh 650lbs (300kg) - the size of a polar bear . 
  But the calculations don’t take into account an alien planet’s surface gravity .
