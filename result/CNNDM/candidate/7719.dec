Indonesia Institute president Ross Taylor says the proposed alcohol ban could deter Australians from holidaying in Bali . 
  He says the Bali Nine execution is third on the list of concerns . 
  The number of Australians visiting Bali is up 16 . 
 7 per cent in the past two months . 
  Mr Taylor says a proposed ban on alcohol is more of a concern than the execution of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan . 
  The proposed ban could become law by the end of the year .
