Shelly Sterling has been awarded most of the nearly $3 million she had sought to be returned . 
 Her lawyers successfully argued that money used to buy V. Stiviano a house, luxury cars and stocks was her community property . 
 Stiviano's lawyer had argued the gifts were made when Donald and Shelly Sterling were separated . 
 Ruling comes nearly a year after Stiviano's recording of Donald Sterling making racially offensive remarks that cost him ownership of the Clippers . 
 Shelly had filed the suit  about a month before the recording of Donald telling Stiviano not to associate with black people
