Campaigning group GetUp launched The Gender Price Gap website last week . 
  The website has exposed nine everyday items that cost more for women than men . 
  Members and everyday consumers have identified identical female versions of the same products . 
  Bonds shirts and shaving razors are among the products that have female versions which cost more . 
  Campaigner Kelsey Cooke said the costs accumulate over time .
