University of Illinois scientists have created the first 3D simulation of merging black holes in a disk . 
  It shows what happens when two supermassive black holes collide  . 
  The simulation was led by scientists at the University of Illinois . 
  It swoops around the disc of superheated material known as a quasar surrounding the black hole . 
  And the simulation comes after two black holes were found to be seven years from merging . 
  Gravitational waves - ripples in space-time - are also predicted to be created by the merger .
