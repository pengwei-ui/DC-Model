Amateur photographer Nicolas Locatelli captured the unusual cloud in the sky above Briones Regional Park in California . 
  The fire-breathing dragon appears to breathe fire in the images - just in time for St George's Day tomorrow . 
  The images were taken at dusk and appear to be a likeness to the fire breathing dragon slain by St George .
