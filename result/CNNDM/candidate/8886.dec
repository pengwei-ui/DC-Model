Fossicker Ashley Manzie found the medal in a Melbourne park last week . 
  It belonged to Frederick George Biddulph who served with the 23rd Australian Infantry Battalion at Gallipolli between 1914 and 1915 . 
  Sydney man Stephen Norton is the great-nephew of Frederick . 
  He thinks the medal belongs to his brother Lewis 'Bunny' Biddurph . 
  Frederick never joined the army because he lost two fingers 'blowing up fish' The medal is thought to have belonged to Lewis because he had poor hearing . 
  Frederick died nine years before his brother in New Zealand .
