The six-month-old 'Seven' had fallen from a building in Zetland, inner-east Sydney . 
  It was taken in by a vet clinic and sustained serious injuries including a broken jaw, broken leg and bruised lungs . 
  The cat was found lying on the ground covered in maggots and blood . 
  My Vet Animal Hospital shared the story of Seven on social media . 
  Since then, many have donated funds to help pay for his medical bills and surgeries .
