Illume ArcLighter creates a ‘super high-intensity’ electrical arc . 
 It uses electricity stored in a lithium ion battery instead of standard fuel . 
 Arc is smaller than an open flame, but is much hotter and doesn't flare up . 
 Device is available to pre-order via Kickstarter for CAD$40 (£21 or US$32)
