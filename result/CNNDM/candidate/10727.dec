Mahendra Ahirwar suffers from a rare condition that makes his neck bend and his head hang from his body . 
  His weak backbone means he can't stand or walk and is restricted to a sitting position . 
  His parents say they have consulted more than 50 doctors but none could diagnose his condition . 
  Mahendra and his mother Sumitra say they would rather see him dead than continue to suffer .
