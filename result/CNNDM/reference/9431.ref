Robert Tomanovich first hung a noose and a Confederate flag, printed with the slogan 'I ain't coming down,' on a fence at his Michigan home . 
 Neighbours complained so an employee of Tomanovich's hung a second noose outside his tree-cutting business . 
 Tomanovich said he simply liked the colors of the flag and his wife claimed the noose was a tribute to a dead friend of her husband . 
 He has since taken down the nooses and flags, but refuses to apologize .
