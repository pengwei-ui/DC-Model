Manchester City's hopes of retaining the Premier League title were dealt a hammer blow after a 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace . 
 Vincent Kompany and City players were visibly frustrated and the Belgian even manhandled referee Michael Oliver . 
 Glenn Murray and Jason Puncheon gave Palace a 2-0 lead before Yaya Toure scored what proved to be a consolation for City . 
 For the 16th league game this season, City fielded a starting line-up with no English outfield players .
