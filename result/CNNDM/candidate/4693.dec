Durham University scientists studied a 'clump' of dark matter that appears to be lagging behind its galaxy . 
  The discovery was made around the Abell 3827 cluster 1 . 
 3 billion light-years away . 
  Dark matter is confusing because it interacts with nothing - including itself . 
  It was thought dark matter did not interact with anything other than gravity . 
  But Durham University researchers found a clump offset from a galaxy by 5,000 light years . 
  This suggests dark matter interacts with itself through force of gravity . 
  This is the first time dark matter has been seen interacting with itself .
