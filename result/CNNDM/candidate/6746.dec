Former Staff Sgt Charlie Linville lost his right leg and several fingers in an explosion in Afghanistan in 2011 . 
  He is using a specially designed metal foot outfitted with a climbing boot and another one with crampons in his quest to conquer the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) summit next month . 
  His quest last year was thwarted following the deaths of 16 Sherpa guides in April when an avalanche stopped him at the base camp .
