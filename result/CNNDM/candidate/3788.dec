University of Manchester researchers have revealed an HD dark matter map  . 
  It shows clumps of mystery particles across 0 . 
 4 per cent of the sky . 
  The goal is to eventually map 12 . 
 5 per cent over five years . 
  A team from the University of Manchester has spent the past two years measuring the shapes of galaxies used to construct the map . 
  And the map should allow astronomers to study how galaxies formed in the universe . 
  It is the first in a series of maps that will eventually allow a 3D view of dark matter .
