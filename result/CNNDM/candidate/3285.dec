Wandsworth council is set to remove the rule giving automatic place to a pupil's brothers and sisters even if the family has moved out of the catchment area . 
  More than 80,000 children face missing out on their preferred primary school . 
  Wandsworth will remove sibling priority from September 2016 in a bid to give priority to children who live closest to schools .
