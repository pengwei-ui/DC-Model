Prosecutors said James Holmes was once a sought-after neuroscientist-in-training . 
  But evidence shows that months before the shooting he was preparing for violence . 
  The prosecution is trying to prove that Holmes was not mentally ill and knew exactly what he was doing when he opened fire in Aurora movie theater . 
  He killed 12 people and injured 70 more in one of America's deadliest mass shootings . 
  If the 12 final jurors decide he was mentally ill at the time of the shooting, he will be committed indefinitely to a state psychiatric hospital .
