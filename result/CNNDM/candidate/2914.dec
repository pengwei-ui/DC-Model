Students at McGuffey High School in Pennsylvania organized a so-called Anti-Gay Day protest last Thursday . 
  Organizers encouraged pupils to wear flannel shirts and write 'Anti-Gay' on their hands . 
  The event was a reaction to a Day Of Silence event for bullied LBGT students the previous day . 
  Students report being physically bullied and having Bible verses pinned to their lockers .
