Researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory used real skin samples to study microscopic changes that resist tears when pulled apart . 
 They found collagen fibres in dermis change structure when under strain . 
 The fibres go from being a disorganised tangle to straighten and stretch . 
 Scientists hope their findings can help develop new tear-resistant materials .
