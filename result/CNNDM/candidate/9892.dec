511 elephant tusks worth $6million (Â£4m), bound for Laos , were seized upon arrival at a major port in Chonburi province in eastern Thailand . 
  The bust came after customs officials received a tip-off in Laos and Thailand and tracked the containers from Kenya . 
  The ivory was shipped out of Kenya on March 24 and went through ports in Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Singapore .
