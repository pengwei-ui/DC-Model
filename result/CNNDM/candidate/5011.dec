Barry Beavis was fined Â£85 for staying too long in a car park in Chelmsford . 
  He launched a legal bid to overturn his fine at the Court of Appeal saying it was unfair and unenforceable . 
  But judges unanimously dismissed his case saying the fine was not 'extravagant or unconscionable' Motoring groups accused the judges of being 'out of touch' and 'furious' Mr Beavis said he was 'absolutely furious' and will take his case to the Supreme Court .
