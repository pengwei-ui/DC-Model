Barry Bonds has been cleared legally after 11 1/2 years in court . 
 When he answered a question about steroid injections by saying he was 'a celebrity child,' he was convicted of obstruction of justice . 
 A federal court ruled his meandering answer before a grand jury in 2003 was not material to the government's investigation into illegal steroids .
