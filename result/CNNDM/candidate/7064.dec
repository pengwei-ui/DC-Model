Kevin Franklin will switch his lights on every evening in April for Autism Awareness Month . 
  His 15-year-old son Bradley is autistic and the family want to raise awareness for charities . 
  Father put lights up after Christmas but didn't take them down because he wanted to switch them on again in April . 
  Neighbours complained and one wrote a poison pen letter to him . 
  Mr Franklin says he will switch lights on tonight 'out of principle'
