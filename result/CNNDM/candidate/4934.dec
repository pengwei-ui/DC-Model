April Morris of Bennettsville thought sheâ€™d never see her beloved pit bull, Nina Louise, again after she went missing in December 2013 . 
  Months of searching and a $500 cash reward proved fruitless . 
  But this past Saturday she saw footage of the pup's rescue during a cockfighting bust in South Carolina . 
  The malnourished dog had just given birth to ten pups .
