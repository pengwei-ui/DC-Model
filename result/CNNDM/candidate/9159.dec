  Grimes claimed she suffered a broken nose and concussion during a drunken brawl with Saban at her sorority sister's apartment . 
  Saban claimed she was defending herself after Grimes posted 'No one likes Sarah yayyyyy!' on Facebook . 
  Saban and her father Nick Saban were not parties in the lawsuit . 
  Grimes has now asked a judge to dismiss her lawsuit .
