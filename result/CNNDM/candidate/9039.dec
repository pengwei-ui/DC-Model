Manjinder Virk will play pathologist Dr Kam Karimore in the 18th series of Midsomer Murders . 
  Executive producer Brian True-May described the show as the 'last bastion of Englishness' in 2011 because it had no black or Asian characters . 
  He said the show 'wouldn't work' if there was racial diversity among cast . 
  Mr Virk is the first regular Asian character in the ITV police drama .
