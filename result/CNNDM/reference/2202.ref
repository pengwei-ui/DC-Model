Family of Bounkham 'Bou Bou' Phonesavanh settled with Habersham County, Georgia late last month forÂ $964K for his pain and suffering . 
 In May 2014, SWAT police in search of a drug dealer they believed was living at the Phonesavanh home tossed a grenade in Bou Bou's crib . 
 While those officers were cleared of wrongdoing in October, Bou Bou's medical care has surpassed $1million and he still needs more surgery .
