Stroke patients with damage to the right sagittal stratum in the right hemisphere of the brain were far poorer at detecting sarcasm when listening to sentences . 
  Researchers at John Hopkins Medical School in Baltimore found that damage to this area affects the ability to detect sarcasm . 
  Stroke survivors often struggle to recognise when people are being sarcastic . 
  The study found that people with the damage were unable to identify sarcasm in the brains of stroke patients .
