Former BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders made headlines last week after it emerged she had been ‘secretly’ dating the Labour leader when he first met his wife Justine in 2004 . 
  She accused the media of ‘raking over’ Mr Miliband’s past in the run-up to the election . 
  In a Twitter message she said the relationship was 'fleeting and very costly' Mrs Miliband revealed the couple had first met at a London dinner party hosted by Miss Flanders .
