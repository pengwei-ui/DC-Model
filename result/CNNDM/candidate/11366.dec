Thousands of voters have suggested landmarks across the city in Devon to fill the more expensive slots of Old Kent Road . 
  But no one has come forward with ideas for which streets should fill the brown sections of the board . 
  Exeter City Council said there were no areas suitable for the brown spots . 
  The spots are taken up on the London version by Mayfair and Park Lane .
