Nikko Jenkins, 28, was trying to etch the Revelation sign of the beast . 
 But he now has a series of upside-down 9s across his face . 
 It is believed he may use the botched case as evidence he is mentally unstable and therefore ineligible to face the death penalty . 
 Jenkins was convicted of shooting dead four people in 10 days after he was released from prison in Omaha, Nebraska, in 2013 .
