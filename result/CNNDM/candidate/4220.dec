Former FBI Director Louis Freeh was involved in a car crash last summer in Vermont . 
  Current FBI director James Comey and Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy spoke about the accident for the first time . 
  Freeh severed an artery in one of his legs and would have bled to death in just 60 seconds if it weren't for paramedics and an FBI agent on the scene . 
  It's believed that Freeh fell asleep behind the wheel before the August 25, 2014 crash . 
  Eight months later, Freeh is still recovering from the crash and walking with a cane .
