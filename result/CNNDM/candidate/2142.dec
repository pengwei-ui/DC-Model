National Park Service and Secret Service are recommending the addition of half-inch-thick spikes to the White House perimeter fence . 
  A congressman suggested in November that a moat should be built around the building to protect the president and his family . 
  The new spikes will be bolted on to the existing fence while a new 10-foot fence is built . 
  The Secret Service and the National Park Service are replacing the fence with the spikes .
