Scientists in The Netherlands were using the Lofar radio telescope . 
  They found it could measure changes in lightning caused by cosmic rays . 
  A storm can have hundreds of millions of volts over multiple kilometres . 
  The method could provide a novel way to understand thunderclouds  . 
  The experiment observed how cosmic rays were affected by lightning as they passed through it . 
  This provided information on the electrical field of a given storm .
