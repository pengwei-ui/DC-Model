Photos obtained by Daily Mail Online show surgeon to the stars Dr Brandt, who hanged himself in Miami on Sunday, the year he graduated from his New Jersey high school . 
 They are in sharp contrast to the razor sharp cheek bones, sunken eyes and platinum blond hair of the well-known dermatologist . 
 Dr. Brandt was mercilessly lampooned in Tina Fey's NetFlix show . 
 He was a 'Jewish kid from Newark' who was described as 'scholarly' with an infectious grin by his peers . 
 He was voted Most Ambitious and Most Talkative student .
