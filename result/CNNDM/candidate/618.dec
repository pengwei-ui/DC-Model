New NHS guidelines urge GPs to draw up end-of-life plans for over-75s and younger patients . 
  They are also being told to ask whether the patient wants doctors to try to resuscitate them . 
  NHS says the guidance will improve patients' care but medical professionals say it is 'blatantly wrong' and will frighten the elderly .
