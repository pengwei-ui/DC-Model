Nasa scientists in California have revealed a distant image of Curiosity was taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter from 187 miles up . 
  The orbiting spacecraft captured a shot of Curiosity near the base of Mount Sharp in Gale Crater . 
  But interestingly the roverâ€™s tracks are not visible - possibly because they have been swept away by the Martian weather . 
  This is the first time in 2015 that the rover has been spotted on the surface of the red planet . 
  The HiRise camera is able to take images of the surface with a resolution of 10 inches (25cm) per pixel . 
  Curiosity is parked over dark sand in a valley with light-toned outcrops of rock .
