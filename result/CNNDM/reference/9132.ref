The Fregoe family of Massapequa Park, New York built their own Frosty in January . 
 Thanks to late winter storms that stretched into spring, the family was able to keep the snowman alive for months . 
 The snowman finally melted this weekend, when temperatures reached a high of 75 on Saturday and 57 on Sunday . 
 Mike Fregoe is keeping a small snowball in the freezer to start a new snowman next winter .
