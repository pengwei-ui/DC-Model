A federal court of appeals threw out the obstruction of justice conviction on Wednesday . 
  The home run leader was convicted in 2011 of saying he was 'a celebrity child' before a grand jury in 2003 . 
  The court ruled that his answer before the grand jury was not material to the investigation into illegal steroids distribution . 
  He was sentenced to 30 days of home confinement and two years probation in 2011 . 
  On April 22, 2015 the court reversed the conviction and said he could not be tried again .
