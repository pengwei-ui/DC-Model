Scientists at Jyväskylä University in Finland say eye-spots on butterfly wings mimic the eyes of owl butterflies to scare off predators like great tits . 
  Owl butterflies have eye spots that mimic those of pigmy owls to scare away predators . 
  Previously it was thought the eye spots may simply confuse predators by confusing them with the patterns on their wings . 
  But the new study shows that the patterns do in fact mimic owl eyes .
