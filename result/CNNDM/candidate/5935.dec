London-born street artist Plastic Jesus erected seven 'NO Kardashian Parking Anytime' signs around Los Angeles this week . 
  He says he came up with the idea while driving down Melrose Avenue a few weeks ago . 
  The signs are in front of the Kardashian sister's clothing store Dash  . 
  Plastic Jesus says the signs are not meant to target the Kardashian family but the reality TV obsession in general .
