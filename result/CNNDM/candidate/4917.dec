There is an insufficient supply of the adult whooping cough vaccine in Australia . 
  The adult vaccine will not be available in Australia until July . 
  It comes less than a month after the death of baby Riley Hughes who died after contracting the disease . 
  His parents are urging adults to get themselves and their children immunised . 
  Riley died at just 32 days old after contracting whooping coughing . 
  Medical professionals say the shortage will not affect the immunisation programs for babies and children .
