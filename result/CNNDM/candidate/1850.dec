Scientists took CT scans of baby teeth found at two sites in north Italy belonged to ancestors of modern humans known as the Protoaurignacian culture . 
  They found the teeth had thicker enamel than Neanderthal teeth and were 40,000 years old and are the oldest modern human remains in Europe . 
  They say the arrival of this group led to the demise of Neanderthals . 
  The group arrived in southern Europe at the same time as the Neanderthal species disappeared .
