Researchers at the University of California found a new type of virus that infects bacteria that live deep below the ocean floor . 
  The virus actively causes one of its own genes to mutate to survive in harsh environments . 
  They found the virus in bacteria living in methane vents 2,800 feet beneath the surface of the ocean in the Santa Monica basin off the coast of California . 
  The researchers believe the virus may be the secret of life on Earth . 
  They also found a similar virus in the bacteria known as archae .
