Lawyers have warned that HBO's 'Going Clear' might not be broadcast by Sky Atlantic . 
  The Alex Gibney-directed film alleges abusive practices at the religion's US headquarters . 
  It was due to premiere in the UK earlier this month but Northern Ireland is not subject to the 2013 Defamation Act . 
  This means Sky is set to postpone or cancel the show entirely . 
  Lawyers have warned the show could expose broadcaster to libel claims from David Miscavige and other prominent Scientologists .
