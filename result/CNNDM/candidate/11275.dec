Lucy Garrod had worn contact lenses for 12 years with no problems . 
  But she woke up one day with an itchy and irritable right eye . 
  Tests showed she had an ulcer known as a corneal abrasion caused by a bacterial infection . 
  The bacteria grew under her right lens and she was left partially blind in her right . 
  She feared she would not be able to complete her photography degree . 
  She learned to take photographs with her left eye and passed with first class honours .
