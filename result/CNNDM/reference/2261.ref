James Krainich was almost two when he toppled from second floor window . 
 Mother Michelle Newman 'heard a pop' and then saw his heels disappear . 
 James died in hospital nine years ago after losing consciousness from fall . 
 His family play games at his grave every year and hope their story will be a warning to other parents about dangers of putting furniture near windows .
