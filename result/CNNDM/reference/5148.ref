Charlesetta Taylor, 79, may have her home of 70 years torn down by the city of St. Louis . 
 This so the city can make way for a campus for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency . 
 The city may also tear down 49 other homes to make sure the NGA does not leave the city, and take the 3,000 jobs it provides . 
 There are three other sites being looked at that would not displace as many people .
