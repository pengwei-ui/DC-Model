Peter Ustinov bought the Aston Martin DB4 Cabriolet in 1962 shortly after winning a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in Spartacus . 
  The car cost £4,000 and was delivered to him at a Swiss hotel when the average house price in Britain was just £2,500  . 
  It is expected to fetch £1million when it goes up for auction at Bonhams next month . 
  This is more than double the £431,200 it sold for in 2011 .
