Artist Betty Willis designed the famous neon sign in 1959 . 
 The sign sits in a median in the middle of Las Vegas Boulevard south of the Strip and is a popular tourist attraction . 
 In 2009 it was placed on theÂ National Register of Historic Places . 
 No one owns the copyright to the sign, so it is often imitated and appears on all kinds of souvenirs in Las Vegas and elsewhere .
