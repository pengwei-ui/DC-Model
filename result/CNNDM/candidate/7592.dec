Each tomb was filled with bones of up to 60 mummies from the ancient ceremonial site known as Tenahaha . 
  Archaeologists have opened up seven of the tombs in Peru's Cotahuasi Valley . 
  171 broken mummies were recovered from the site after rats ate away at them . 
  The tombs may have served as a 'neutral ground' to bury their dead and feast .
