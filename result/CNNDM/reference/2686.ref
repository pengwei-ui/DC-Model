Austin Bird sat for coffee on Tuesday morning in the town of LeClaire, Iowa, chatting with Hillary Clinton as photographers snapped pictures . 
 News reports called him a 'student' and her campaign called it an unscripted event . 
 But Clinton's Iowa political director Troy Price drove Bird and two other people to the coffee house . 
 Bird is a hospital government relations official who interned with Barack Obama's 2012 presidential campaign . 
 The Iowa Democratic Party, which Price ran until a month ago, tasked him to be Joe Biden's driver during an October Senate campaign trip in Davenport .
