Elderly fishermen in Guilin, China, keep the unusual, ancient tradition of cormorant bird fishing alive . 
 The bird, which they have often raised from a chick, dives into the water and retrieves a carp for its owner . 
 This is an ecologically safe way of fishing, as the birds are not harmed and the men only catch what they need .
