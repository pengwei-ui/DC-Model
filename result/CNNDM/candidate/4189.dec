Rickie Lambert has scarcely been given a chance at Liverpool this season . 
  Mario Balotelli was given more time on the pitch in the FA Cup semi-final defeat by Aston Villa . 
  Lambert scored 20 goals for Southampton last season . 
  Brendan Rodgers has ignored him in favour of Balotlli . 
  Lambert should have joined Aston Villa in January .
