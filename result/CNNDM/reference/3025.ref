Pooch Mavis was brought to Arlington Park in Mobile sometime last weekend by her owner for a fishing trip . 
 Mavis was reportedly close to the park's boat launch as an alligator attacked her and came out of the water . 
 Mavis was viewed as a 'neighborhood dog' in Mobile's Midtown section . 
 Local resident Nicole Lavirriere has said of Mavis 'I think she's like the Norm of "Cheers"'
