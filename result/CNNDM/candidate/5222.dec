A dozen Native American extras and the cultural adviser walked off the set of Adam Sandler's new movie The Ridiculous 6 on Wednesday . 
  Loren Anthony said he was offended by the script's jokes about their race and culture . 
  He said the extras were dressed more like Comanche than Apache and the costumes were stereotypical . 
  The movie is a spoof of The Magnificent Seven that stars Sandler and Nick Nolte . 
  The extras walked off set after the film was written and directed by Sandler . 
  The film is set in New Mexico and is set to be released next year .
