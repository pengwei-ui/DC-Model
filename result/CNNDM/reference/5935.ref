The seven signs around Hollywood were erected this week by street artist Plastic Jesus . 
 He says he got the idea while driving down Melrose Ave a few weeks ago . 
 A Kardashian shopping on the street caused such a ruckus that traffic was stopped on the busy avenue and he thought 'how is this news?'Plastic Jesus says the signs aren't meant to target the Kardashians specifically but the obsession with reality TV stars in general .
