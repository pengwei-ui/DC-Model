Riley Filmer has been prevented from attending classes at McClelland College in Melbourne . 
  The 14-year-old turned up for classes on the first day of term wearing new shoes . 
  She was told the black leather lace-ups did not meet uniform standards . 
  Her mother Anne Parker said her daughter needed a more practical and comfortable shoe . 
  The Year Eight student has not been allowed back into classes since Monday . 
  The school has offered to buy her a new pair of shoes . 
  The uniform policy states that girls are to wear 'black Leather lace-up school shoes (not fashion heels)' for summer and winter .
