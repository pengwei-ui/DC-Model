Bogan Shire Council in NSW is planning a statue to honour its namesake . 
 It would depict a 'bloke' in shorts and singlet carryingÂ a rod and tuckerbox . 
 Mayor Ray Donald said the statue could have tourism benefits . 
 Would join the trend for 'big' things in country towns . 
 Existing icons include the big Merino, the big banana and the big pineapple .
