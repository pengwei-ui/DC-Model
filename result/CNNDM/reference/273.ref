Tyler Grant claims a Whataburger in Texas denied service because Grant was wearing a dress . 
 The Whataburger says they did not let Grant enter because the outfit in question was see-through . 
 'If it were see-through, then she would have seen my brightly colored underwear,' Grant said on Facebook . 
 Grant claims the outfit consisted of five pairs of tights . 
 Grant is still deciding whether or not to pursue legal action .
