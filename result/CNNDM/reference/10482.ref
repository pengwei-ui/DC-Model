Joe Root has been terrific to bounce back from a difficult time in Australia . 
 Root's 182* in the first innings in Grenada showed he is a steely competitor . 
 He looks a natural No 3, but England shouldn't move him from current spot . 
 The captaincy always wears players down, and it isn't his time yet . 
 Ben Stokes is right to be passionate, but needs to keep his cool as well .
