For many of the residents of Santa Barbara d'Oeste and neighboring Americana in Brazil's southeastern Sao Paulo state having Confederate ancestry is a point of pride . 
  Sunday marked the 150th anniversary of the end of the American Civil War . 
  Thousands turn out every year at the annual 'Festa dos Confederados,' or 'Confederates Party' in Portuguese . 
  Many trace their ancestry back to the dozens of families who settled here from 1865 to around 1875 .
