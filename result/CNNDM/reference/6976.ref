Hannah Overton will not be tried on murder charges again in the death of her adopted son . 
 Overton was found guilty in the 2006 of killing her adopted sonÂ Andrew Burd, who died of acute salt poisoning . 
 Overton has denied killing the boy from the start and her husband and five children have stood by her side . 
 Late last year her conviction was overturned because of ineffective counsel, but Nueces County district attorney Mark Skurka was set to try her again . 
 Skurka filed a motion to dismiss however and the judge granted his motion .
