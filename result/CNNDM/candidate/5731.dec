Alanna and Stephan Goetzinger lost their daughter Rana in 2012 . 
  Coroner James McDougall said the midwife was 'grossly inadequate' and may have contributed to the baby's death . 
  The baby died 'during or shortly after birth' from meconium aspiration . 
  The couple have said that Rana was stillborn and that the coroner's report was fabricated . 
  The midwife changed the time of the birth and changed her statement about whether the baby showed signs of life . 
  Alanna and Stephen said they are not blaming their midwife . 
  Rana died either during birth or within minutes of birth .
