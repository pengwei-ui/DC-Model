Jane Laut, 57, stands accused of shooting dead her bronze medalist shot-putter husband Dave Laut in August 2009 . 
 Laut claims self-defense while prosecutors say she's a murderer -- however, they were unable to get a case together by the time of the trial . 
 When a California judge threw out the prosecution's request again delay the several times postponed trial, they dropped the charges and refiled . 
 The defense calls the maneuver an unprofessional delay tactic almost unheard of in a murder case .
