Scientists quizzed more than 5,000 British teenagers about their drinking habits and the films they had watched from a list of 50 . 
  Those who had watched the most were 20 per cent more likely to have tried alcohol and 70 per cent to binge drink . 
  Between 1989 and 2008 almost three quarters of popular films depicted alcohol use - but only six per cent were classified as adult only .
