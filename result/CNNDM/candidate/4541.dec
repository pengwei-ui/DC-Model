Rowdown Primary School in New Addington has banned all drinks except water during the school day . 
  Headteacher Linda Shute says the rule is to protect the long-term health of pupils at the school . 
  She has banned tea, coffee, fruit juice and soft drinks . 
  But parents have launched a petition to overturn the water-only rule . 
  They claim many children go all day without a drink because they do not like water .
