On Monday a nine-week-old puppy named Lt. Dan was given to three-year-old Sapphyre Johnson who is missing both of her feet . 
 'He's just like me!' Sapphyre exclaimed with joy the first time she ever saw a photo of Lt. Dan . 
 'He's a special dog and he's going to a special child,' said an employee at Shriner's Hospital .
