Philip Gigante was elected into the position by residents of Airmont . 
 His grandfather was Vinny 'The Chin' Gigante, head of the Genovese gang . 
 The mobster walked around in a bathrobe and slippers to look insane . 
 That way he felt like he would avoidÂ prosecution, and did in 1990 . 
 He was jailed in 1997 for federal racketeering and died in prison aged 77 . 
 Philip hopes his 'achievements' will be what his constituents .
