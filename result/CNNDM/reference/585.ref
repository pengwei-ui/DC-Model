The image of the patterned stripes in the Saharan desert was captured by the Nasa's Landsat 7 satellite . 
 They are examples of linear, or longitudinal, dunes in Erg Chech - a desolate sand sea in southwestern Algeria . 
 'Erg' comes from the Arabic word for 'field of sand dunes' and the cause of such shapes is not known . 
 Theories include helical roll vortices - rolls of rotating and spiralling air - and seasonal changes in wind direction .
