Australian Securities and Investments Commission took action against Aldi last year after an investigation revealed it did not disclose a 0 . 
 5 percent surcharge on transactions made using tap and go . 
  ALDI failed to disclose the surcharge it charges consumers paying by credit card in some of its stores . 
  Aldi told the regulator it would put up signs at the entrance of stores and at registers to notify customers of the fees . 
  Some stores still do not have signs at entrances and signs at registers are in tiny print .
