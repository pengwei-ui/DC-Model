Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin signed a law allowing the state to use nitrogen as an alternative method of death . 
  The gas chamber method is 'fast and painless' and has been touted as 'foolproof' in the wake of a botched lethal injection last year . 
  Nitrogen is now the state's second choice after the electric chair . 
  The new law gives the state four ways to carry out the death penalty .
