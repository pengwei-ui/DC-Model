Park Crescent West was designed by Buckingham Palace architect John Nash in the early 19th century . 
  Developer PCW Property Holdings has submitted plans to demolish the crescent and rebuild it as luxury flats . 
  Park Crescent West is next to Regents Park in London and will be made up of 73 homes ranging from studios to five-bed flats . 
  Residents are furious at the plans and say they will be forced to live with noise and disruption . 
  PCW paid Â£105million for the Grade I listed crescent in 2013 .
