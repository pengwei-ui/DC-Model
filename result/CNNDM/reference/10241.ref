Eight animals are dead, including at least one alligator that once belonged to Michael Jackson after a fire last week at an Oklahoma zoo . 
 The zoo's founder, Joe Schreibvogel, said the fire was most likely set by rogue animal rights activists who have been targeting the zoo . 
 Schreibvogel:Â 'The building can be replaced...Michael Jackson's alligators cannot be replaced'
