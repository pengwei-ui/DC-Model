Activists installed Snowden's bust on top of century-old Prison Ship Martyrs Monument at Fort Greene Park before dawn Monday . 
 It took them six months to create the 4-foot-high, 100-pound bust sculpted out of plaster-like material and made to look like bronze . 
 Bust was accompanied by block letters spelling out 'SNOWDEN'Less than 10 hours after installation, parks workers swooped in and took down the statue . 
 The unsanctioned bust appeared in the park just hours after HBO aired John Oliver's interview with Edward Snowden .
