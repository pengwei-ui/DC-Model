The weather system is called an East coast low. It is formed from low-pressure over the Tasman Sea . 
 They draw strong, moisture-laden winds across the coast, which cause heavy rain to fall . 
 They are particularly common in June and can dump hundreds of millimetres of rain . 
 They usually move away after 12 hours but this one is going to stick around for 24-36 hours . 
 East Coast Lows were common in the 1970s but became less common in the 90s .
