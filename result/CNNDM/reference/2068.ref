It has long been known that Earth is constantly oscillating and 'humming'Earthquakes cause a certain level of hum, but a study claims different sized ocean waves also contribute to Earth's oscillations . 
 As water collides, it creates weak microseismic waves that cause a hum . 
 Stronger seismic waves then occurs when water travels along the floor .
