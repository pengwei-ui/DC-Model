Abiotic methane is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide . 
  The gas forms through chemical reactions in the crust beneath the seafloor . 
  One reservoir was discovered on the Knipovich ridge in the deep Fram Strait of the Arctic Ocean . 
  The reservoirs are secure and scientists don't believe they will impact climate change . 
  Instead, they say similar formations could someday be used to store methane that can be used as fuel .
