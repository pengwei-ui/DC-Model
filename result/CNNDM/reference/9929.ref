Human bones found at Gough's Cave in Cheddar Gorge, Somerset, bore cuts  and bite marks proving the people there engaged in ritual cannibalism . 
 The remains have been found to be 14,700 years ago and belonged to prehistoric modern human hunter-gatherers known as theÂ Magdalenians . 
 Skulls found in the cave also had been cut and shaped into bowls and cups . 
 Researchers at the Natural History Museum in London believe cannibalism may have been regular part of disposing of dead relatives at the time .
