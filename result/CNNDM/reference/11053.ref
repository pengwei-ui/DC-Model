Ken Broskey Livonia, Michigan, has been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and his doctors have urged him to check into hospice care . 
 Instead he has taken a job with Uber to earn money to pay off his mortgage before he dies so his daughter and grandchildren can have his house . 
 Roland Gainer, a college student, started a GoFundMe page for Broskey after meeting him which has almost reached its $95,000 goal . 
 Uber is also donating $1 to the page when people write UberPartnerKen into their app when requesting a ride this weekend .
