Jasper and Jasmine were surrendered to Pug Rescue and Adoption Victoria in 2013 with a variety of health problems . 
  They were morbidly obese and almost blind but found a loving home with Alison and Matt Rowe . 
  The couple will be 'married' in a charity event in May to raise money for Pug Rescue . 
  The ceremony will be held at the St Kilda beachfront in Melbourne . 
  Pug Rescue runs entirely on donations and vet discounts . 
  More than 300 people and 60 pugs are expected to attend the event . 
  The wedding dress will be designed by pug lover Craig Braybrook .
