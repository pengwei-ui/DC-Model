After scoring a try on Friday night, David Pocock gestured in sign language to a friend . 
 Miranda Devine mistook it for 'jazz hands', calling him a 'tosser' on Twitter . 
 The Rugby player gracefully corrected Devine, who promptly apologised . 
 Social media went into a frenzy following the exchange .
