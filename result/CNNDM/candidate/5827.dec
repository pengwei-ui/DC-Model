Researchers subjected Lithium-ion batteries to heat and used thermal imaging to observe changes in their internal structure . 
  Copper inside the battery reached temperatures of at least 1,085°C (1,985°F) This caused jets of molten material to burst from its vent . 
  It is the first time the failure of Li-ION batteries due to overheating has been recorded by University College London . 
  The batteries are vulnerable to a condition known as thermal runaway .
