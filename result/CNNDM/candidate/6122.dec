Tony Morris QC is mounting a landmark legal challenge against Queensland's speed-camera laws . 
  Mr Morris says he wasn't driving when his Volvo was photographed doing 57km/h in a 50km/H zone last year . 
  He has invoked a spousal privilege case from 1817 to avoid a $146 fine . 
  He argues it's unconstitutional for a Queensland court to fine him when there's evidence he was not the driver . 
  He says he was in a meeting with top judges when the Volvo was snapped . 
  But he won't say who was behind the wheel .
