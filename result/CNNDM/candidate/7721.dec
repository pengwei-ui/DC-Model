Sweden study analysed DNA from 21,566 men convicted of sex offences . 
  Sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders are four to five times more likely to commit crimes than the general population . 
  Only 2 per cent of the connection could be explained by shared environmental factors . 
  This is because genes and environment cannot be considered independently of each other . 
  The findings are unlikely to help prevent sex crimes .
