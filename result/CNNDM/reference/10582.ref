Several DEA agents were participating in alleged sex parties in Colombia starting in 2001 according to a new report . 
 The parties featured prostitutes paid for by drug cartels . 
 This news comes two weeks after a report found that at least 7 agents admitted sleeping with prostitutes while on overseas assignments . 
 Instead of firing or prosecuting agents, the DEA treated prostitution cases as 'local management issue' and suspended them for no more than 14 days .
