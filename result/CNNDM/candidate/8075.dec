Specialised 77 Brigade launched in January to combat Islamic State’s domination of the internet and social media . 
  Brigade is in disarray after failing to enlist the right personnel . 
  It was expected to be made up of 2,000 social media and psychological warfare exponents . 
  But when fully operational it will number just 454 regular and reservist troops . 
  Brigade commander says he needs computer whizzkids skilled in ‘social media, financial operations and counter-criminality’
