Fishermen in Guilin release a cormorant bird each morning to catch carp  . 
  The birds then dive into the water and retrieve a carp from the fisherman's reed raft . 
  The fishermen just take the fish right out of the bird's mouth  . 
  The unusual method was first practiced in 960 AD and was captured by a Russian photographer  .
