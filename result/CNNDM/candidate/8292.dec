Tom Moffatt was meant to ink 'Riley' - the name of his son into his left arm . 
  But instead of the letter 'L', he started needling the letter P and had to urgently 'scribble' over the mistake . 
  NHS worker from Ashton-under-Lyne in Tameside was drunk at the time . 
  He also attempted to mark himself with his son's nickname 'Sonny Boy' The makeshift tattoo was done with a Â£70 ink gun bought online . 
  Mr Moffatt now faces hours of agonising laser surgery to remove the ink .
