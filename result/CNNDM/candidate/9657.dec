President Barack Obama is calling for an end to conversion therapy treatments for gay, lesbian and transgender youth . 
  The move comes in response to an online petition posted on the White House website following the death of 17-year-old Leelah Alcorn . 
  The petition currently has over 120,000 signatures . 
  The transgender teen committed suicide in December and left behind writings mentioning religious therapy .
