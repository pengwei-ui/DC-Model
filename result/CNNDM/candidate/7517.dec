Greek researchers created the algorithm which determines a person’s state of intoxication by looking at the temperature of their face - especially the forehead and nose . 
  Researchers from the University of Patras took thermal infrared photographs of 41 volunteers’ faces, before and after drinking four glasses of wine . 
  They built an algorithm to recognise intoxication with 90% accuracy . 
  Technology could one day be installed in cars to spot drink drivers .
