FBI director James Comey suggested in remarks last week that Poles were accomplices during the holocaust . 
 Comey's comments are offensive to Poles as they had no role in running death camps and were themselves victims of the Third Reich . 
 Poles see themselves as heroes of the war who have never been properly recognized, making the comments yet more hurtful . 
 The remarks came shortly before the 72nd anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, which was commemorated on Sunday . 
 The U.S. ambassador to Poland, Stephen Mull, was called to the Foreign Ministry in a formal act of protest .
