Elizabeth Dawes was told she had breast cancer in July 2013 at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton . 
  Doctors told her she needed immediate surgery and chemotherapy . 
  But four days after the operation she was told staff confused her notes with those of three other patients and she had never had the disease . 
  Mother-of-one underwent surgery to remove 'cancerous' tumour and lymph nodes from her right breast . 
  She was working as a breast cancer care nurse at the hospital at the time . 
  NHS Trust has admitted liability and issued an apology to Ms Dawes .
