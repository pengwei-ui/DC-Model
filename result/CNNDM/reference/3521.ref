Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat insists he is not underestimating the significance of Sunday's game against local rivals Newcastle . 
 While in charge of Rangers in 1998, Advocaat made the mistake of playing down the Old Firm game against Celtic and lost 5-1 . 
 The Dutchman does not want a repeat of thatÂ embarrassment . 
 He is considering starting winger Adam Johnson for the game, for the first time for his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl .
