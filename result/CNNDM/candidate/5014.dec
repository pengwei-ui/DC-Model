Austin Carey and Jay Rawe were left with broken vertebrae after a base jump off Pennine Bridge in Idaho went wrong . 
  Mr Carey was told he may never walk again and Mr Rawe suffered fractures to his spine . 
  The pair plummeted 500ft onto a riverbank when their parachutes tangled . 
  But one year on both have returned to base jumping and Mr Carey has even retraced his steps to the bridge .
