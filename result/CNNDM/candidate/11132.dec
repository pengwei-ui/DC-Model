Fossils of a creature bearing a 'striking' similarity to Nessie were found in a 19th century collection in Inverness Museum and Art Gallery . 
  Scientists have revealed that 'Pessie' may have lived at the bottom of the freshwater lakes that would later become Loch Ness . 
  The fossils belonged to a species known as Pterichthyoides milleri  . 
  The fish ancestor roamed Earth's freshwater lakes between 542 million and 251 million years ago . 
  Fossils were rediscovered by the president of the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club .
