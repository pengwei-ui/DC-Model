Pensions Minister Steve Webb said over-55s ‘don’t have to rush the pension reforms . 
  Pension reforms allow over- 55s to cash in their pension pots rather than be forced to buy an annuity . 
  But he has urged people to take their time and not make rash decisions . 
  Yesterday was Pensions Freedom Day - the biggest pension reforms in a century .
