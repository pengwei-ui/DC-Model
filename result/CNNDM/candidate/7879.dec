Belinda Bartholomew claims she was racially abused at a Bondi butcher on Monday night . 
  She was buying a chicken for her and Roosters star Aidan Guerra to cook for dinner . 
  She said she was told to 'go to a f***ing Aussie butcher' when she asked for a different chicken . 
  But the man working at Sam The Butcher in Bondi denies he called her names . 
  He says she was the one being rude and is 'lying' and trying to ruin the business . 
  The chicken was cooked for a Game Of Thrones-inspired dinner  .
