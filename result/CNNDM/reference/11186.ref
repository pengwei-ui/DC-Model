Chelsea edged closer to the Premier League title after a 0-0 draw with Arsenal on Sunday . 
 The Blues were criticised in some quarters for an over-defensive display . 
 Jose Mourinho has shrugged off those claims and said that the real boredom was in Arsenal's 11-year-wait to win a league title of their own . 
 He hailed the individual performance of his captain John Terry as the defender's 'best ever' in his career .
