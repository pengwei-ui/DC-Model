Charity Bite-Back believes as many as one in five Chinese restaurants are selling shark fin soup . 
  Legal loophole allows people to bring 20kg of fins into the country if it is for personal consumption . 
  Royal China Club in central London was raided after boasting of selling the soup and another dish made from shark teeth . 
  Charity workers say restaurants are either disguising the soup on their menus as 'fish fin soup' or are offering it to Mandarin speaking customers .
