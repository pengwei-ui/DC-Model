Tianwen Chen and his wife Gairen have adopted 40 disabled children over the last 26 years . 
  The couple found their first child in a box on the roadside in 1989 . 
  They gradually took in more and more disabled children in their home in central China . 
  Sadly nine of the children died and 12 have been adopted by other families . 
  The Chens are now able to afford to send 12 children to school .
