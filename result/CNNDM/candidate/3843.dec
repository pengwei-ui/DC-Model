Sydney radio station 2UE merged with rival station 2GB last week . 
  What looks to be a tweet from a disgruntled former employee emerged on Twitter on Thursday morning . 
  'Apologies for the s*** news service these days  . 
  #bringbackblanda', the tweet said . 
  The tweet was in reference to the station's former newsreader Steve Blanda . 
  2UE denied the tweet came from their Twitter account . 
  Last Thursday the Sydney office of 2UE broadcast its last bulletin . 
  The Sydney newsroom has been merged with 2GB . 
  Jobs were also lost at Brisbane 4BC and Magic 1278 IS Brisbane .
