Tok researchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS . 
  It would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit . 
  The system would have a range of 62 miles (100km) and could target things less than 0 . 
 4 inches (1cm) away . 
  Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earthâ€™s atmosphere . 
  The paper was written by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo . 
  System would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target debris up to 62 miles away .
