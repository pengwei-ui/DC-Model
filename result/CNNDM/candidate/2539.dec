Lian Doyle agreed to hide the trainers worn by Justin Robertson when he murdered Pennie Davis in September last year . 
  Robertson was paid Â£1,500 by the son of the victim's ex-lover Benjamin Carr . 
  Mrs Davis was found dead in a paddock in the New Forest in September 2014 . 
  Doyle pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and was sentenced to 10 months in prison . 
  She thought Robertson had worn the trainers to commit a burglary . 
  Mr Robertson was jailed for life yesterday for murder of Mrs Davis .
