Sir Oliver Popplewell conducted the 1985 Bradford City fire inquiry into the tragedy . 
  The fire at Valley Parade stadium killed 56 people and injured 265 in May 1985 . 
  A new book claims the fire was one of at least nine at businesses owned by or associated with the club chairman Stafford Heginbotham . 
  Popplwell says police should look at eight other fires allegedly connected to the then club chairman to 'see if there was anything sinister'
