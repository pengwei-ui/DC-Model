Researchers studied stone tools used by people in the Early Ahmarian culture in south and west Europe and west Asia around 40,000 years ago . 
  They found the human tools were no more effective than Neanderthal-created tools . 
  Traditionally, scientists believed innovation in weapons enabled humans to spread out of Africa to Europe and survive . 
  But study by Nagoya University and the University of Tokyo in Japan argues Neanderthals were just as well-equipped as humans .
