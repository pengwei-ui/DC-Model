The Mark 1 version of the iconic plane was one of the first Spitfires to go into action, and was  built in March 1940 . 
 But Spitfire P9374 never made it to Battle of Britain as it crash-landed on French beach and lay hidden for 40 years . 
 At one point it was almost certainly flown by Squadron Leader Roger Bushell, later Big X of the Great Escape fame . 
 The wreckage was discovered in 1980 and restored to its original condition. It is to be auctioned for Â£2.5million .
