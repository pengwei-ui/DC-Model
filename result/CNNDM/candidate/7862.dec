Four-poster oak wood bed was dumped in car park of Redland House Hotel in Chester . 
  It was left in the car park by builders who were renovating the property and sold for Â£2,200 in 2010 . 
  TV historian Jonathan Foyle has confirmed it was once owned by King Henry VII  . 
  He said DNA testing on the bed's timber proved it once belonged to the Tudor monarch . 
  The intricately-carved bed was left to be picked up by auctioneers . 
  It features carvings of Henry and his wife Elizabeth of York and may have been conceived in the bed .
