Heather Hironimus and the boy's father, Dennis Nebus, have been warring since her pregnancy . 
 They were never married but share custody of their 4-year-old child . 
 In a parenting agreement filed in court, the two agreed to the boy's circumcision . 
 HironimusÂ later changed her mind, giving way to a long court battle . 
 She filed a federal civil rights complaint late Monday . 
 It repeats the claims that surgery on her 4-year-old son isn't necessary, that the boy doesn't want it, and that his constitutional rights are being violated .
