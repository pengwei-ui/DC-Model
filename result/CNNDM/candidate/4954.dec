James Anderson plays his 100th Test match in Antigua on Monday . 
  Anderson needs just three wickets to go level with Sir Ian Botham as England's top Test wicket taker . 
  Peter Moores allowed Anderson to play his natural game when on England duty . 
  Anderson 'wouldnâ€™t say boo to a goose' says former Lancashire captain Warren Hegg .
