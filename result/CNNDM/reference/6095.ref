Sutherland Council is exploring idea of allowing overseas backpackers to park their campervans in allocated locations right on the beach . 
 Cronulla and Wanda beach are often ignored by tourists due to expenses . 
 This motion was proposed due to the economic boost backpackers bring . 
 Seasoned travellers spend $700 on eating out and shopping during a stay . 
 Some locals believe it cannot be done due to rising land values in Cronulla .
