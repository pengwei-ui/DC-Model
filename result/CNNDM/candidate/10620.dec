Research by wildlife charity the WWF identified 11 'deforestation fronts' where 80 per cent of projected global forest losses by 2030 could occur . 
  The areas are the Amazon , the Atlantic Forest and Gran Chaco . 
  The fronts are home to indigenous communities and endangered species . 
  By 2030 170 million hectares (420 million acres) of forest could be lost in just 11 hotspots, including the Amazon and eastern Australia . 
  The huge amount of global deforestation is expected to occur in less than a dozen global hostpots .
