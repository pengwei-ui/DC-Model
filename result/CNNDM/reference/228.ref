Lance Futch, 26, was shocked to discover that his 'informal meeting' with a federal official to discuss jobs for veterans was actually with President Barack Obama . 
 'If I had known it was my Commander-in-Chief, I definitely would have been wearing my blues,' said Futch, referring to his NationalÂ Guard dress uniform . 
 Futch works for Utah solar energy company Vivant Solar and discussed with the President whether the field offered stable career paths for veterans .
