Kathy Hughes called her dad Doug Hughes 'a patriot' for landing his gyrocopter on the West Lawn last week to protest campaign finance laws . 
 Speaking out on Monday, Mr Hughes called the journey 'a huge thrill' and said he never feared he'd be shot down . 
 He said it would be worth losing his job and going to jail if the country took note of his message . 
 He faces four years in prison for crossing a no-fly zone and is under house arrest in Florida before a hearing in Washington D.C. next month .
