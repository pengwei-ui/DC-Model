Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates inspired the experiment at a care home in Riverdale, New York . 
  Residents are woken up each day with a video recording from a loved one to help ease confusion and agitation . 
  The idea is borrowed from the 2004 film in which Drew Barrymore uses videos to remind herself of her loved ones . 
  The videos are shown to residents of Hebrew Care Home in the city each day .
