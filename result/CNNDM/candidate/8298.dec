Mike Hand from Haydock became wheelchair bound after being diagnosed with a tumour on his spinal cord . 
  The 39-year-old is almost ready to leave St Helen's Hospital after surgery and rehabilitation . 
  He and his wife Kate tried to claim for a disability grant to adapt their home . 
  But they were told they would have to earn 'virtually nothing' to receive the grant . 
  Mr Hand has been told he can only have the grant if his wife gives up work and goes on benefits .
