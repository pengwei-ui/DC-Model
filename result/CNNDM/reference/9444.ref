A second terrifying eruption from the Calbuco volcano in southern Chile has forced over 4,000 to leave their homes . 
 The cities ofÂ Puerto Varas and Puerto Montt are covered in ash and locals are becoming frightened for their health . 
 Yesterday's blast, which shot ash six miles into the air, was the first since 1972 and the first major one since 1961 . 
 No one is thought to have died from the two explosions but Chile's president has declared a state of emergency .
