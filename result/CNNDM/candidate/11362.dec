YouTube entertainer Yousef Saleh Erakat disguised himself as a homeless man to see what would happen if he offered people on the street his own money instead . 
  He said he wanted to 'flip the script' and find out if it was acceptable for the rich to give money to the poor . 
  One man threw a $10 bill at him and said 'I don't need your f***ing money' Another man told him to 'P*** off' when he offered to pay for a parking meter .
