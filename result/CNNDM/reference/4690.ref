A report has shown that only 9 percent of homes in last quarter have recorded a loss at their sale with nearly a third selling for double what owners paid . 
 The total vale of these profitable resales was over $17 billion three and a half times more than the total of the loss . 
 Sydney recorded the lowest loss-making resales at just 2.4 percent which is down from 3.5 percent in a year . 
 The typical home is now owned for over ten years before it is resold with Melbourne homes being held longest .
