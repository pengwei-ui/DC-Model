Marc Macrae was election agent for SNP’s Westminster leader Angus Robertson . 
  He said the party showed compassion for the Lockerbie bomber but ostracised him . 
  Like Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi – he was diagnosed with prostate cancer . 
  Mr Robertson has not even contacted him to ask how treatment has gone . 
  He is now backing Tory candidate Douglas Ross to oust Mr Robertson in Moray .
