Hernandez was moved on Wednesday to the maximum-security Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, Massachusetts . 
 He had been at Cedar Junction prison in Walpole since he was convicted April 15 of killing 27-year-old Odin Lloyd in 2013 . 
 Souza-Baranowski is Massachusetts' newest and most advanced prison . 
 Hernandez's cell will have a bunk, writing desk and stool, a combination sink and toilet and room for a TV, if he wants to spend $200 .
