Several thousand people gathered outside the city's main railway station Flinders Street on Friday afternoon . 
  The protest was against government plans to close down remote indigenous communities in Western Australia . 
  This comes as the Queensland Police Service refuses to issue an apology to an Indigenous officer after claims the word 'Abor' was written on his station roster .
