Yakov Naumi was raised in an ultra orthodox Jewish home in the town of Bnei Brak . 
  He photographed rituals and ceremonies performed by his community in a series of images . 
  The images include a man lying in a grave to prolong his life and a chicken being walked on a string . 
  Naumi admits that some of the rituals 'look strange' to an outsider .
