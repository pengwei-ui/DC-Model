Prime Minister admitted he suffered a 'brain fade' during a speech in Croydon . 
  He urged the audience to support West Ham instead of Aston Villa . 
  The PM has always claimed to be a Villa fan and has been a fan since his teens . 
  Last week he tweeted his delight at the club reaching the FA Cup final . 
  He was outlining his vision for black and ethnic minority communities . 
  He said he was a West Ham fan - though the two teams play in different colours .
