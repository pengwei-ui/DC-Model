John Oliver flew to Moscow to grill Edward Snowden about 'harmful' documents he leaked . 
  Snowden admitted he did not read all of the documents he sent to journalists . 
  He said he was only 'evaluating' the files stolen from GCHQ and the US National Security Agency . 
  He admitted there had been a 'f***-up' when newspapers failed to redact sensitive details . 
  Snowden said such blunders were the 'fundamental price of liberty'
