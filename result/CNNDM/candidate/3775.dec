Aaron Hernandez was found guilty of first-degree murder of Odin Lloyd on Wednesday and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole . 
  His fianc√©e , Shayanna Jenkins , sobbed and hugged the killer's mother after the verdict was read . 
  Her sister Shaneah Jenkins sat across the aisle from her sister in the Massachusetts court . 
  The two sisters were close until Hernandez's murder trial left them on opposite sides of the case .
