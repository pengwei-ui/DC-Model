Researchers at Yahoo Labs in California have created a sensor that can recognise the shape of your ear or any other body part you want to access your device . 
  Called Bodyprint, the technology turns a standard touchscreen into a biometric scanner . 
  To accept an incoming call users would only need to press their ear against the phone . 
  Bodyprint was devised by Christian Holz, Senaka Buthpitiya and Marius Knaust from the California-based Yahoo Labs .
