Illume ArcLighter creates a ‘super high-intensity’ electrical arc between two ceramic electrodes . 
  Instead of using a spark and fuel mechanism like traditional lighters, it uses electricity to ignite candles and paper . 
  The device contains a rechargeable lithium-ion battery and is the first flameless gadget of its kind . 
  Its inventors are raising money for the lighter on Kickstarter . 
  It costs CAD$40 (£21 or US$32) and is expected to ship in November .
