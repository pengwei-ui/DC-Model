Nasa has been testing a flexible wing on a plane in California . 
  The wing can bend from -2 degrees up to 30 degrees . 
  It means that regular flaps aren't needed - and it is much lighter . 
  The breakthrough could increase fuel efficiency up to 12 per cent and reduce noise at take-off and landing up to 40 per cent . 
  It is able to morph itself like a bird to provide the same functionality as normal flaps - but with much less weight . 
  The latest test of the technology took place in Edwards, California .
