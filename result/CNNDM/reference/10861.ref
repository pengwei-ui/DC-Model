A photographer has captured images of amazing caves near a volcano in the Russian Far East . 
 Denis Budkov, 35, trekked inside the dangerous caves to capture the colourful scenes on show . 
 In the images pink, yellow and green ice can be seen on the roof of the cave . 
 The fantastic colours are the result of sunlight streaming through the glacial ice .
