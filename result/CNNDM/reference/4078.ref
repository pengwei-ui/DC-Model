Yaphank in Long Island was founded in part by the German American Bund, a pro Nazi group that flourished in the 1930s . 
 They established Camp Siegfried in 1935 as a place for like-minded Aryans to drink beer, hold military demonstrations and learn about eugenics . 
 Yaphank remains a town in Long Island, but gone are the roads once called Adolf Hitler Street, Goebbels and Goering .
