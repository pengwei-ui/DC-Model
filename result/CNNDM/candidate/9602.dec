Metropolitan Police investigating Hatton Garden gem heist missed 'crystal clear' footage of Â£60m raid . 
  It was handed into police by a worker based 50ft from the crime scene on Monday last week . 
  Worker reportedly contacted 101 believing detectives would already have similar images . 
  But police have refused to make the footage public - despite claims it is of higher quality . 
  Comes after force was criticised for ignoring alarm that went off on Good Friday . 
  The footage is said to be of a significantly higher quality than that released last week  .
