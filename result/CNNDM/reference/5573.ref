Boris Majnaric, 75, of South Jordan, built the 384-sq-ft, four-room bird house in 1996 and went on to rear more than 200 birds . 
 Local laws stipulate that residents must not keep more than 40 birds . 
 Majnaric fought a four-year battle with the city council to keep his flock . 
 However, he finally lost the case and last Tuesday the aviary was destroyed .
