Leeds Rhinos have sent full back Zak Hardaker on an anger management course after a violent incident in February . 
  Hardaker was at the centre of a police assault probe into an attack on a 22-year-old student . 
  He and team-mate Elliot Minchella both paid Â£200 in compensation and wrote a letter of apology to the victim . 
  Hardakers will forfeit one month's salary to be donated to a local charity . 
  He received a five-match ban and a fine for a homophobic comment made last year .
