Deputy PM said control of Department for Education would be a key demand of any new power-sharing deal . 
  Mr Clegg said he wanted to avoid a repeat of 'ideological gimmicks' of Michael Gove .

  He was demoted from running the ministry in last year's Cabinet reshuffle . 
  Lib Dems have sought to claim the mantle as the 'party of education'
