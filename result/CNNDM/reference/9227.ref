John Caudwell has bought a car park in Audley Street, Mayfair and is planning to replace it with a huge block of flats . 
 The new complex will contain five townhouses, a mews house, three penthouses and 21 more luxury apartments . 
 The homes being built by Phones4U entrepreneur will boast their own swimming pools and private gyms . 
 But he could have difficulty with planning permission if VIP neighbours object to proposal for four-storey basement .
