President Barack Obama is calling for an end to psychiatric therapy treatments aimed at turning gays into heterosexuals . 
 The move comes in response to an online petition posted on the White House website following the death of 17-year-old Leelah Alcorn . 
 The American Psychiatric Association has long opposed conversion therapy and says being gay is not a mental disorder .
