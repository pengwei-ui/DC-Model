Group of vicars say CoE schools should stop selecting pupils on faith . 
 Many Christian schools give priority to those who regularly attend church . 
 But vicars argue the system is open to abuse and oversubscribed schools may reject non-churchgoing families even though they may live nearby . 
 Clergymen said affluent parents were more likely to cheat the system by going to church just to get their children into a high-performing CoE school .
