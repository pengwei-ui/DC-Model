Burnley manager Sean Dyche is keen to protect striker Danny Ings . 
 Ings has not scored since February as Burnley battle relegation . 
 Although Dyche would like Ings to return to form as soon as possible, he has made it clear other Burnley players must step up to the plate as well . 
 The 1-0 defeat by Everton last time out has left Burnley bottom of the Premier League table with 26 points from 33 games .
