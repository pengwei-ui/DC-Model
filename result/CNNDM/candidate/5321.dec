Norwich scientists have developed an adaptor for colour blindness . 
  Eye2TV can be plugged into any HDMI port on a TV or a computer monitor . 
  A remote control or app then adjusts the colour adjustment . 
  It allows colour blind people to watch shows they otherwise couldn't  . 
  The team from the University of East Anglia in Norwich is seeking funding on Kickstarter . 
  It adjusts colours in the image so that shows look 'normal', even if they feature colours such as red and green . 
  And the subtle effect is such that people with normal vision will barely notice it . 
  The adaptor plugs into the HDMI port of a TV and can be used with an app or remote .
