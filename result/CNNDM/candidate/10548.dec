Sian Harkin abused her position of authority by signing cheques totalling £30,000 to her builder Lee Slocombe . 
  She claimed the work was to be carried out at Llwyncelyn Primary School in Porth, Wales . 
  But the builder carried out £80,000 worth of work at her home in Pontypridd . 
  Harkin used the school chequebook when she was headteacher of the school . 
  She also continued to use it when she moved schools . 
  Married mother-of-two claimed the money was to build a rain shelter at the school but it never materialised . 
  She was jailed for 12 months after admitting fraud at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court
