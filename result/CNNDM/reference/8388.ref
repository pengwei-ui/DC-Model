 The location is only accessible by bus or private car, and the company enlisted the help of prolific Instagrammers . 
 Eight photographers from Denmark and Scotland embarked on an incredible roadtrip . 
 They used the hashtag #MovingSkyewards so others could join in on celebrating the picturesque area . 
 Together the photographers have over a million followers on the social media site .
