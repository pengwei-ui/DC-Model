Lewis Hamilton sprayed champagne in Liu Siying's face after winning Chinese Grand Prix . 
  The 23-year-old was pictured grimacing as he aimed the fizz directly at her face . 
  Sexism campaigners have called his behaviour 'selfish and inconsiderate' But the hostess said she was just doing her job and wasn't offended by it . 
  She was a 'podium girl' at the race and was a fan of Kimi Raikkonen . 
  Hamilton has sprayed champagne at grid girls before after winning races .
