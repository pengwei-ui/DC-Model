Tulsa County Sheriff's Office reserve deputy Robert Bates faces a charge of second-degree manslaughter for the April 2 shooting of Eric Harris . 
 In an interview on the Today show on Friday, he described his shock and remorse at the shooting and how he never intended to kill anyone . 
 He demonstrated that he kept his Taser near his chest and his gun on his right side - but insisted the mix-up could have happened to anyone . 
 Bates said he had completed all proper training and was not allowed to 'play cop' just because he had donated equipment to the sheriff's office .
