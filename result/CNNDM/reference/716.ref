Kefalonia is stunning and doesn't play the Captain Corelli's Mandolin card . 
 Island hasn't been tainted by the crowds  its Greek counterparts get . 
 It's a quarter of the size of Spain's Majorca but with a 20th of the  tourists . 
 The one must-do outing in Kefalonia is to Fiskardo , a lovely harbour .
