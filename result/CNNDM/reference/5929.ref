The 11 teachers, testing coordinators and other administrators were convicted Wednesday of racketeering after a five-year investigation . 
 Evidence of cheating was found in 44 schools across the Atlanta school system, with nearly 180 educators involved . 
 A racketeering charge could carry up to 20 years in prison and most of the defendants will be sentenced on April 8 . 
 The cheating came to light after The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2008 that some student's scores were statistically improbable . 
 Prosecutors said the educators were guaranteed bonuses by inflating scores, while improving the poor reputation of their school system .
