Jia Huaijin quit his job as a civil servant to revive the dying art of sword making . 
  He now hand-makes swords that sell for up to Â£22,000 each in rural China . 
  The technique dates back 2,000 years to the Han Dynasty . 
  Mr Jia uses molten metal forged in a furnace to make the swords . 
  He moved to a remote farm with his wife to set up his own workshop .
