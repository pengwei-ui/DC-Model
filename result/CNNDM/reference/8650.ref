Alice Barker danced in legendary Apollo and Zanzibar clubs during the 1930s Harlem Renaissance, as well as movies, TV and commercials . 
 But she had lost her old photographs with time, and no one could find her videos because of a misspelling of her name . 
 David Shuff, who met Barker years ago, reunited her with some of her short musical films known then as 'soundies'The videos now play in the common room of her retirement home, where Shuff says she is a 'rock star'
