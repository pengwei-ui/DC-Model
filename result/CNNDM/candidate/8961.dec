  The U . 
 S . 
  Supreme Court last year ruled that Hinton had 'constitutionally deficient' representation at his initial trial . 
  Jefferson County Circuit Judge Laura Petro on Thursday dismissed the case against Hinton . 
  The district attorney's office told the judge that their forensic experts couldn't determine if six crime scene bullets came from a gun found at his home . 
  Hinton will go free on Friday after spending nearly 30 years on death row . 
  His attorney said he was innocent because he was poor .
