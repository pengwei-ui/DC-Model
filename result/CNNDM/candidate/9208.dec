Mario Balotelli has no future at Liverpool after manager Brendan Rodgers lost patience with the striker . 
  Balotlli shared a thermometer reading on social media to prove he was too ill to play against Blackburn . 
  Rodgers will admit he ignored the warning signs but had hoped the Italian was maturing as he got older . 
  Liverpool paid Â£16m to sign the Italian striker from AC Milan .
