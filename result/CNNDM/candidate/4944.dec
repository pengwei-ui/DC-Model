Tiffany Williams and Jessica Versey became close friends during treatment and went into remission . 
  Miss Williams was cleared of Hodgkin lymphoma earlier this month . 
  They took to social media to post images of themselves - including one of her bald head and another of Miss Versey’s chest scar . 
  But these were reported for being ‘offensive’ to Facebook .
