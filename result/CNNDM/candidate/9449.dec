Biologists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem studied the movement of octopuses . 
  They found that the orientation of the creature's body and the crawling direction are controlled independently in the brain . 
  The creatures can move in any direction by pushing with their legs rather than pulling . 
  It is the first time scientists have been able to understand how the creatures control their movement without a rigid skeleton .
