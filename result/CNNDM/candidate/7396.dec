Find Boston Bombers moderator Chris Ryves set up subreddit after Boston Marathon bombings . 
  He says he lost control of thread after millions of users took to it to theorize about bomber/suspects' identities . 
  In days after attack, users hurled false accusations at spectators wearing backpacks  . 
  This led to 22-year-old Sunil Tripathi being wrongly identified as the bomber . 
  Ryves has told of regrets about thread in new documentary , The Thread  . 
  Documentary will be released on iTunes on Monday .
