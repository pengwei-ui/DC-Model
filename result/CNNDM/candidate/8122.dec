Biso squeezed into the hole in the wall at the Mohamed Naguib metro station as a kitten in 2010 . 
  He survived thanks to an elderly man called Uncle Abdo who fed him scraps of food every day . 
  But the cat became too big to escape and was stuck behind the wall for five years . 
  Animal activists finally freed him after a picture of his tail was posted on Facebook .
