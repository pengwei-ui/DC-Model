A six-month-old kitten was found lying on the floor in Sydney last month . 
 It sustained a broken jaw, broken leg, broken hard palateÂ and bruised lungs . 
 The owner surrendered it to the vet as he could not afford the medical bills . 
 Small vet clinic raised funds to help pay for the kitten's treatments . 
 It is now on the road to recovery and will be ready for a new home in six weeks .
