The alarm clock rouses individuals from their slumber using a focused beam of light and sound . 
  It is mounted on a wall and has an inbuilt sensor to detect sleepers’ body heat . 
  The device emits focused ultrasonic waves to wake up each person individually without disturbing their partner . 
  It uses a white LED to slowly illuminate the area around a sleeper’s face to gently wake them up . 
  The Wakē alarm costs $250 (£167) on Kickstarter and is due to ship in September .
