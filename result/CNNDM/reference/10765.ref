Opulent palace in Tripoli - which once had a zoo, fairground and pool - was razed to the ground during revolution . 
 Libyans were 'even afraid to look at walls of palace', for fear of being arrested while Gaddafi was in power . 
 Now his former strongholds lie in ruin, after civil war which devastated country and saw Gaddafi killed by rebels .
