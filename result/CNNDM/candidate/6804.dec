Deborah Fuller dragged her dog Tango for 400 metres behind her car in Essex . 
  The Rhodesian ridgeback was left with injuries to his paws and chest . 
  Fuller was banned from keeping animals for five years and had her 27 other dogs confiscated . 
  Judges ruled that the dog's suffering could have been avoided if she had taken him to the vets earlier .
