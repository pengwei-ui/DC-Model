A New Jersey father accused his ex-wife of 'abusing her parental discretion' by taking their daughter to the December 2013 concert at the Prudential Center in Newark . 
  The girl's parents are divorced and the parents have joint custody . 
  The father said he disagreed with the 'sexually suggestive' nature of the singer . 
  Judge Lawrence Jones said the concert was age-appropriate . 
  Jones ruled that while the singer's works can be suggestive, they are preteen- appropriate .
