Vice correspondent Gianna Toboni traveled to India to explore the country's booming surrogacy industry for a documentary about the surrogacy business . 
  She went undercover to meet with an agent who offered to sell her a baby over dinner . 
  The agent told her that there were 'extra' babies being sold on the black market . 
  Commercial surrogacy in India costs one-sixth of what it does in the US .
