Molalla Log House could have been built as early as 1795 - ten years before Lewis and Clark reached the Pacific Ocean . 
  Historic building repairer Gregg Olson and architectural historian Pam Hayden have been analyzing the log cabin for seven years . 
  They believe the structure is unlike anything else found in Oregon and was built by foreigners  . 
  They believe it was built for a small settlement of Russians sent to the Willamette Valley as farmers to feed fur traders in Alaska  . 
  The cabin's intricate construction is similar to Russian log cabins .
