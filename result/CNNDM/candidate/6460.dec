Palaeontologists led by the University of Alberta examined a pair of fossils found in Mongolia . 
  They say that the key differences between the sexes lie in bones near the base of the tail . 
  They found male oviraptorosaurs had broader and longer chevron bones in their tails so they could shake their feather-tipped tail to woo potential mates . 
  They suspect females had shorter tail bones to make laying eggs easier .
