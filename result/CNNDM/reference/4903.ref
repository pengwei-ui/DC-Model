England close day one of first Test against West Indies on 341 for five . 
 Ian Bell, Joe Root and Ben Stokes all played well to lead the recovery .

 When England were 34 for three I received a lot of comments about my supposed motivational skills. I replied that I only spoke to the middle order .
