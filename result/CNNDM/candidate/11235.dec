Woolworths launched 'Fresh in our Memories' last week in the lead up to Anzac Day . 
  The supermarket invited Australians to upload images to remember those who fought for their country . 
  The website was branded with a 'fresh in our memories' slogan and logo . 
  It was branded 'disrespectful' and 'disgusting' by customers on social media . 
  Woolworths has been forced to halt the campaign .
