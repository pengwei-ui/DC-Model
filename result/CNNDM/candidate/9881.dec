Online retailers stock T-shirts with slogans such as 'I heart my stalker' and 'Some people call it stalking . 
  I call it love!' The Suzy Lamplugh Trust says the shirts mock a serious issue which affects one in six women . 
  Charity says they play into people's fear of being laughed at and prevent victims from seeking help . 
  The shirts are sold in US and UK stores including Zazzle .
