Despite having several tattoos while in the Marines, Sgt. Daniel Knapp has been denied re-enlistment because of his ink . 
 After leaving he got a pair of crossed rifles and 0311 designation for Marine riflemen on his forearm . 
 The tattoo contravenes the organization's strict policy concerning size and placement . 
 'My tattoos never stopped me from shooting anyone,' said Knapp of Jacksonville, North Carolina . 
 He is now considering joining the Army which has less stringent rules about body ink .
