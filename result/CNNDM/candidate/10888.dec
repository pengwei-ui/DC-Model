Justine Jones was left covered in huge sores and in agony after opening the bottle of Tesco Finest Garnacha wine to celebrate her daughter's birthday . 
  Her mother Jan Jones had bought the bottle for granddaughter Abi's 18th birthday . 
  But when they opened it they found it contained a clear liquid which smelt of bleach . 
  The next day she was covered in angry red welts and had to go to hospital .
