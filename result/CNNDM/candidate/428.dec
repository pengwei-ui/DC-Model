Jemma Peacock has a rare form of stomach cancer and is currently taking three drugs to prolong her life . 
  The third and most effective drug - regorafenib - has been removed from NHS England's approved list of treatments . 
  Mother-of-two says the NHS is denying her two daughters their mother by refusing to fund the life-saving drug . 
  She has set up a 100,000-strong petition for the drug to be funded . 
  But she has not told her daughters Kacie and Willow that she has cancer . 
  She is currently on Â£1,000 a week and says she cannot afford to buy the drug privately .
