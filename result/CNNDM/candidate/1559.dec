Sue Sharp bought the leg of lamb from Asda in Midlothian, Scotland . 
  The packaging claims it was born, reared and slaughtered in the UK . 
  But a stamp on the meat said it had been flown from New Zealand . 
  Asda apologised and said the gaffe was an 'isolated incident' But Mrs Sharp has refused to accept it was a one-off .
