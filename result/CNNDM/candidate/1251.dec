Fire boat Massey Shaw was requisitioned from the London Fire Brigade in 1940 . 
  It helped to rescue 600 troops from the beaches of Dunkirk and helped to save St Paul's Cathedral in the Blitz . 
  The fire boat was decommissioned in 1971 and restored to its former glory . 
  Volunteers are now hoping to transport the boat back to the beaches to mark the 75th anniversary of the evacuation . 
  The boat can pump out 3,000 gallons of water every minute .
