Euan Ritchie and Jen Martin launched a crowdfunding page to track the numbers of kangaroos in the Northern Territory . 
  The couple received a pledge for over $2 billion from Jeffrey Green . 
  The money was to be donated to a kangaroo preservation project . 
  Within an hour the pledge vanished and the couple have not been able to track down the would-be benefactor .
