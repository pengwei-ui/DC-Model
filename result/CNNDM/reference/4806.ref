Mystery man wandered into Polish Embassy yesterday with no memory . 
 The only clue to his identity is a distinctive flower tattoo on his right arm . 
 He can't recall his own name, how he lost his memory or came to be in UK . 
 All he could remember that he was from Poland and his daughter Lenka .
