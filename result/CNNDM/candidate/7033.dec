Sainsbury’s app is in development and will be trialled in Wandsworth later this year . 
  It lets shoppers build up a list of items they need over a week . 
  When they enter a store, a map will appear on the phone showing where their groceries are . 
  As they scan items, a live pricing tool will show their list with current store prices . 
  The app is an extension of Sainsbury's current Scan-and-Go scheme . 
  It is currently being trialled at a store in Wandsworth and will be rolled out next year .
