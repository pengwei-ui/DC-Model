Scientists at Haverford College in Pennsylvania say they have spotted X-ray emissions consistent with thousands of white dwarf stars at the galaxy's centre . 
  These are stars left behind after larger ones use up their fuel . 
  But why there are so many of these stars remains a mystery . 
  The finding was made using Nasa's NuStar telescope .
