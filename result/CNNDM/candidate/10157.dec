Physicists at the University of Oregon believe the hats were rolled up ramps to reach the top of the Moai figures on Easter Island . 
  Some 1,000 carved Moai line the perimeter of the volcanic island . 
  The hats were made of red stone and would have been rolled up a ramp . 
  Despite the size of the statues, Sean Hixon believes the rolling of the 'pukao', or 'hats,' was relatively easy . 
  Some of the figures measure up to 40ft (12 metres) tall .
