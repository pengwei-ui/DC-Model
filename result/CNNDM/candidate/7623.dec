Sea Shepherd vessel 'Bob Barker' rescued 40 crew members from the sunken vessel named Thunder on Monday . 
  Sea Shepherd had been pursuing the vessel for 110 days in an effort to stop alleged poaching activities in Antarctic waters . 
  Captain Peter Hammarstedt said the captain of the vessel 'started applauding and cheering' when the ship sank . 
  Thunder is one of six vessels known to illegally fish vulnerable toothfish in the Southern Ocean . 
  The vessel issued a distress signal saying it was sinking off the coast of Africa . 
  All 40 crew were rescued safely and are in the care of Sea Shepherd . 
  The sinking is believed to be a deliberate move to hide evidence of poaching .
