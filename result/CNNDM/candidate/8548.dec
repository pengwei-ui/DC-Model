The huge lump was 40 metres long and caused the 1940s sewer in Chelsea to break . 
  It was discovered beneath Draycott Avenue and Walton Street after residents complained of a rancid smell . 
  Thames Water have now been forced to repair the sewer at a cost of Â£400,000 . 
  The waste removed from the sewer is the equivalent weight of five Porsche 911s .
