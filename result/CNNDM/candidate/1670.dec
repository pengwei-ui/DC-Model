Seven women from Brigham Young University believed they were in an online relationship with a Mormon man living in Texas . 
  They found out they had been duped by a woman named Kayla who was pretending to be a man . 
  The women confronted Kayla on an episode of Dr Phil on Friday . 
  Kayla apologized and said she was trying to figure out who she was because it was 'difficult' to be gay and Mormon . 
  She had taken the identity of a man named Keagan from Montana .
