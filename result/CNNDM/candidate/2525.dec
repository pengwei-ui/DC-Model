Arman Nejad dragged the teenager into his house and raped her in October 2009 as she walked to a youth club in Manchester . 
  He was free for several years after the attack because of a bungled police investigation . 
  The victim went to police in 2010 and was interviewed but the case was dropped . 
  Three years later she complained and detectives arrested him and charged him with rape . 
  Greater Manchester Police admitted 'unacceptable delays and failures' and he was jailed for five years on Friday .
