Hamish Baillie claims Lord Janner abused him during a game of hide-and-seek in 1983 . 
  He claims he was molested when he was aged 15 in a children’s home in Leicester . 
  He said the decision not to prosecute him for the fourth time was a 'complete travesty' Alison Saunders said dementia made the 86-year-old unfit to plead . 
  He waived his right to anonymity to say the decision ‘beggars belief’ and points to establishment cover-up .
