Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg promises to 'spread the burden' of deficit reduction . 
  Mr Clegg set out plans for £5billion in new tax rises and a £3 billion cut from welfare . 
  Car tax would rise by £25-a-year and £7billion raised from a crackdown on tax avoidance . 
  But he scaled back his plans for a mansion tax amid concerns it could cost the party support in affluent parts of London . 
  He mocked George Osborne's insistence that £12billion can be found from welfare budget . 
  He warned that it was 'quite simply impossible' to find savings from welfare and Whitehall .
