Margaret Hesketh went in to the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan with an infected bed sore and suspected pneumonia . 
  Medics told her family she was riddled with tumours and had fluid and nutrition drips removed six days before she passed away . 
  Family claim she was then put on a discredited Liverpool Care Pathway-style treatment for the dying . 
  But post-mortem found no sign of cancer in the 70-year-old and she died of pneumonia while malnourished .
