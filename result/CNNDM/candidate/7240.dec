Davion Navar Henry Only was formally adopted by his former caseworker Connie Bell Going in Florida on Wednesday . 
  He had spent his entire life in foster care after his mother gave birth to him behind bars . 
  In 2013 he made a plea for a family to 'love him forever' at his church in St Petersburg . 
  He has been adopted by Connie since he was seven years old . 
  'Thank you all for being my family,' Davion said during the adoption proceedings .
