Charlotte Briggs was refused a place at Lydgate Junior School in Sheffield . 
  She can see the school from her bedroom window but was offered place at Shooters Grove Primary - more than two miles away . 
  Her mother Lynne says she must quit her job to get her daughter to school and back every day . 
  Council says school was never a feeder school and she is in catchment area .
