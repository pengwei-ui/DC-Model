Sydney was hit by a hail storm on Saturday afternoon . 
  Marble-sized hailstones pummelled multiple suburbs in the city's east and west . 
  The storm was the result of an East Coast Low or extratropical cyclone . 
  Seven buildings collapsed in western Sydney and a woman had to be rescued from her car in flood waters . 
  The weather could be explained by changing atmospheric conditions and bursts of ice-cold air .
