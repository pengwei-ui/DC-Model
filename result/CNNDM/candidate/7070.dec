BBC drama Wolf Hall has been criticised for being too accurate in its portrayal of the Tudor era . 
  Victoria Miller said the codpieces were too modest for Henry VIII's court . 
  She said they should have been at least double the size of the garment . 
  The inaccuracy was said to have been done so as not to offend American audience .
