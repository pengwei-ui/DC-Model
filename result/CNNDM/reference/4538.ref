Patrick Miller and his friend thought they were staying at a nicer hotel . 
 They arrived to find stagnant, green water in the swimming pool . 
 Hot tub is filled with dead insects and other floating debris . 
 Amenities were antiquated or broken and paint was peeling off the walls . 
 The grounds have uncut grass, dead flowers and downed tree branches .
