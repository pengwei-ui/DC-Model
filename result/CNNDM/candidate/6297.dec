Researchers at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan compared the distribution pattern of skin cells and fairy circles in the Namibian desert . 
  Found in Namibia are large barren patches of earth . 
  The pattern closely matches the pattern of desert fairy circles . 
  Both had six 'neighbours', and similar percentages of other neighbours . 
  Desert fairy circles are considered one of nature's greatest mysteries .
