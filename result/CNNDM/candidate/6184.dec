The images were taken in Jervis Bay on the south coast of NSW  . 
  Photographer Andy Hutchinson described the sight as a 'beautiful supernatural scene' caused by millions of plankton omitting light  . 
  A similar display was shown in Sydney's Manly Beach back in August 2014  . 
  The glow is caused by Noctiluca scintillans which blooms in the spring and autumn  .
