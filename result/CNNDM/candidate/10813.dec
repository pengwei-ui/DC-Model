Kola fireball was spotted on April 19 last year near the Russian-Finnish border . 
  Researchers used camera footage to recreate its trajectory and hunt down the Annama meteorite . 
  It had a 'disturbingly similar' path to asteroid 2014 UR116, which is due to pass by the moon in 2017 . 
  Scientists determined the fireball's path by studying its flight and the meteorite's final impact site . 
  They then created a computer model to compare the two asteroids . 
  The model compared the orbit of Annama with the evolution of a dozen near-Earth asteroids .
