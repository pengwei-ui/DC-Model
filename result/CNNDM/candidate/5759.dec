Experts at Tomsk State University spent a decade analysing bone and teeth samples from mammoths that roamed western Europe and Russia between 10,000 and 30,000 years ago . 
  They found the bones were riddled with osteoporosis and lacking in calcium . 
  Until now it was thought the woolly mammoth died out from climate change and being hunted to extinction by early man . 
  The deficiency in calcium resulted in them breaking their limbs and spines .
