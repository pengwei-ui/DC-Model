Ashton Wood has issued a tongue-in-cheek apology to Jeep and will read it out on  ABC TV's The Checkout tonight . 
 The car company requested he apologise for slamming them after he was not given a refund or replacement for a faulty vehicle he bought in 2010 . 
 Mr Wood instead launched an online campaign to destroy his $49,000 car . 
 He is now campaigning to introduce Lemon Laws in Australia . 
 A spokesperson for Jeep said 'we have and always will treat Mr Wood in a fair and professional manner'
