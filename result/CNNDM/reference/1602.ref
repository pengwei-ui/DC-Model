The Woolworths 'Fresh in our Memories' campaign launched last week . 
 It invited customers to upload images to remember Australian soldiers . 
 The supermarket then added a Woolworths logo and slogan to the image . 
 Customers took to social media to mock the campaign and express their anger with what they saw as a marketing ploy by the company . 
 The soldier whose image was used to plug the campaign is unidentified . 
 All that is know about the young man is that his photo was taken sometime between 1915 and 1918 before the he embarked from Australia for service .
