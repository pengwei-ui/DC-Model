Ava Ciach from Geelong in Victoria suffered from Sagittal Synostosis - two plates at the front of her skull had fused together prematurely restricting the growth of her brain . 
  She had to undergo complex surgery in which she had her skull removed and smashed into pieces and put back together like a jigsaw puzzle . 
  In September last year Ava underwent the operation at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne .
