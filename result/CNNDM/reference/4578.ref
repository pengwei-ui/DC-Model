An earlier version of this article wrongly referred to Erith and Thamesmead's Conservative parliamentary candidate Mrs Anna Firth posting pictures of litter in Bromley to shame her political opponent. We are happy to clarify that the photos were in fact taken in Conservative-controlled Bexley and there was no intention to imply that Mrs Firth was unaware of the constituency boundaries.
