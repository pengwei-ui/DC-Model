Red squirrels have been almost wiped out in England and Wales after rival grey squirrels arrived from America in the 19th century . 
  Native reds have returned to Windermere, in the picturesque Lake District . 
  Experts say a lack of habitats caused them to disappear from the area . 
  Since 1952 95% of red squirrels were wiped out due to the squirrel pox virus carried by greys . 
  But there have been a number of sightings in the Lake District in the last 16 years .
