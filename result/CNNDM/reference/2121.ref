Emma Dickson was taking the contraceptive pill and then was taken to hospital after suffering with sharp pains last November . 
 Doctors said she had developed blood clots, which can be caused by synthetic hormones in the pill, and clots had moved up to her lungs . 
 Clots, or pulmonary embolisms, were wedged in Mrs Dickson's lungs and caused pleural effusion - where fluid starts to build up around the lungs . 
 Fluid caused her left lung to collapse and she thought she would die .
