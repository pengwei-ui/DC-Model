Maglev train completed a test run on a track in Yamanashi . 
  It beat the previous record of 361mph (580km/h) set in 2003 . 
  Another attempt is scheduled for tomorrow . 
  Maglev trains use magnets to lift the carriages above the track . 
  This eliminates the need for wheels and provides a smoother ride . 
  The trains are twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail . 
  The new line between Tokyo and Nagoya will be in service in 2027 .
