Small businesses will struggle to open over the Easter long weekend due to the cost of penalty rates on public holidays . 
  Many operators will face penalty rates of up to two-and-a-half times regular pay . 
  The Australian Chamber of Commerce has launched a Too Big to Ignore campaign . 
  It will allow small retailers and hospitality businesses to put up posters in their windows explaining why they are closed . 
  The penalty rates will come into force from Good Friday to Easter Monday .
