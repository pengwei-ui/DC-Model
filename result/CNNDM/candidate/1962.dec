Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon refused to rule out staging a second independence vote before 2020 . 
  But the idea was ranked 19th on a list of 23 policies presented to voters . 
  Last night Ms Sturgeon said she would not rule out a second referendum if the SNP wins the 2016 Holyrood elections . 
  But a poll by Ipsos Mori reveals voters would rather have a referendum on the EU .
