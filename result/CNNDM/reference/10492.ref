Elizabeth Dawes was diagnosed with breast cancer in July 2013 . 
 Doctors advised a double mastectomy but she refused, instead undergoing extensive surgery to remove a tumour and reconstruction afterwards . 
 Four days later she was told staff had confused her notes with those of two other patients and that she had never had the disease . 
 Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust has admitted liability and apologised .
