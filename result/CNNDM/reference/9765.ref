Nasa scientists in California have revealed a distant image of Curiosity taken by theÂ Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter . 
 It was taken from an altitude of 187 miles (300km) up, revealing where the rover is heading towards . 
 One interesting aspect is that the rover's tracks cannot be seen behind it in the image . 
 This may be due to Martian weather or that they are the same colour as the surrounding surface .
