Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York has pushed back its planned screening of the controversial Iraq war film which was set for last Friday . 
  It said it will still show the Oscar-nominated movie but with an educational forum follow-up to allow students to discuss the film . 
  The film was postponed because senior management did not want to create animosity or tension among students . 
  Muslim students have said the postponement is an attack on free speech .
