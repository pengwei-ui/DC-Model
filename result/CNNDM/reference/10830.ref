Amanda Beringer asked her brother Brad to make a toast at her wedding . 
 The song poked fun at marriage and had the wedding guests in stitches . 
 But the song was also a tribute to their late father Peter . 
 Peter passed away of Motor Neuron Disease 10 years ago . 
 'He'd have wanted everyone laughing and enjoying the day,' says Amanda .
