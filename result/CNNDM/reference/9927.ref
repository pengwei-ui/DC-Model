Police seized Rafi, 10, and Dvora, 6, in a Maryland park on Sunday and their parents say they weren't reunited by CPS for hours . 
 Scientists Danielle and Alexander Meitiv believe in 'free range parenting' meaning the children are afforded total independence from infancy . 
 The MeitivsÂ were found guilty of neglect in March. After Sunday's incident they were forced sign a paper pledging not to leave them unattended .
