Researchers at John Hopkins University in Baltimore showed babies magic tricks where balls seemed to pass through walls and toy cars floated on air . 
 11 month old infants were surprised when objects defied their expectations . 
 The babies then played more with the ball and car when given them later on . 
 Scientists say the children appeared to be trying to work out their secrets .
