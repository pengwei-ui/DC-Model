Ciudad Real airport was built in 2009 at a cost of more €1billion – Spain’s economy having taken off . 
 It was closed just three years later when its parent company fell into financial difficulties . 
 The airport was designed to cater for Spain's booming economy to serve both city and coast via high speed rail link .
