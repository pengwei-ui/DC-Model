The 'Space Bins' have been designed for the next generation of 737s . 
 They can hold six standard-sized bags – two more than the current set-up . 
 That would create enough space for up to 62 more carry-on bags . 
 So far two airlines – Delta and Alaska – have ordered the new luggage bins . 
 Monarch, Ryanair and Thomson have all placed orders for new 737s .
