Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen allegedly told three comrades of Army Sgt . 
  Bowe Bergdahl that the soldier was a deserter . 
  Mullen served President Obama and then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in the White House . 
  The claims mean Mullen was in a position to tell the president about the soldier's desertion five years before he was captured by the Taliban in 2009 . 
  It also raises questions about the prisoner swap for Bergdhal . 
  Bergdahal is charged with desertion and misbehavior and will appear in court in July .
