Researchers from Lancaster University scanned the brains of people reading passages from the Harry Potter books . 
  They found 'arousing words' affected parts of the brain concerned with emotion . 
  The emotional potential of words is rated in terms of valence and arousal ratings . 
  Participants rated passages on valence - from -3 for negative to +3 for positive - and arousal - from 1 to 5 for arousing . 
  MRI scans revealed that one sentence from the Half-Blood Prince was judged to be emotionally arousing - even though it was neutral .
