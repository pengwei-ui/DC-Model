Teresa Bullock captured the two-minute clip at her house in Ohio on the birthday of her 18-year-old Macaque monkey named Angel . 
  The video shows the monkey sitting up on a sink having its eyebrows plucked with a pair of tweezers . 
  Its owner then proceeds to apply what looks like moisturizing cream, eye-liner and red lipstick . 
  PETA said videos like this 'often inspire ill-informed people to obtain monkeys as pets'
