Jon Czerniecki set up trail cameras to spot deer on his grandparents' farm near Wangaratta in Victoria . 
  He accidentally captured a nine hour clash between a kangaroo and a pair of domestic dogs . 
  The video shows the dogs ganging up on the injured marsupial as it lies on its back . 
  He has contacted the local council and Parks Victoria but they are unwilling to help .
