Scientists at Brandeis University in Massachusetts believe the process of converting short-term memories to long-term memory is best carried out when a person is asleep . 
  They studied memory consolidators in fruit flies . 
  When the neurons were activated the flies slept more . 
  But when they were deactivated the flies kept buzzing . 
  The process is called memory consolidation .
