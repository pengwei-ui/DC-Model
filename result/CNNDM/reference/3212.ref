Assistance Dogs are a little known but crucial tool for children with autism . 
 They are used to keep the child safe and encourage social skills . 
 Children with autism often have difficulty with social interactions and their verbal and non-verbal communication skills may be badly affected . 
 Autistic children 'have a tendency to 'bolt' when anxious or stressed . 
 The Assistance Dog is trained to keep a child out of harm's way and make outings more manageable for the carer .
