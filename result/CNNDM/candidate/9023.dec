Shaun Ingram booked his Ford Focus ST in for an MOT and service at Halfords Autocentre in Plymouth . 
  But when he picked it up he discovered it had been driven at 57mph in a 30mph zone . 
  His dashcam recorded seven hours of footage showing mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car . 
  Mr Ingram says the footage shows it was pre-planned and not spur of the moment . 
  Halfords say the mechanic was a temporary employee and has been removed from the job .
