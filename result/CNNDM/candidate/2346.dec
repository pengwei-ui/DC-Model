Chimpanzees in Kibale National Park in Uganda have learned to look for traffic before crossing a busy road . 
  Scientists found dominant males will wait for younger chimps to cross safely . 
  It is the first time the apes have adapted to busy roads in their territory . 
  Chimpanzees also appear to flavour their food with herbs .
