Daniel Weness reported on Tuesday that a storage canister with vials of bull semen had been taken from his farm . 
 The $500 canister held vials worth between $300 and $1,500 each . 
 Theft happened between April 1 and 7, and Weness was away on Easter . 
 There is a market for bull semen because it helps farmers on transportation costs of putting a bull and a cow in the same pen to breed .
