Sprinkles the 33-pound cat is so fat she can't even roll over and she's equally as fat as a 700-pound human, say rescue workers . 
 The neglected cat from New Jersey was handed over to the rescue agency S.O.S Sea Isle Cats by a family facing a foreclosure on their home . 
 Sprinkles will hopefully lose a pound a month and when she does she will be placed in a loving home . 
 A healthy weight for Sprinkles is around 10 pounds .
