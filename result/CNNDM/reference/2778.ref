Wildlife photographer Einar Gudmann caught the violent encounter on camera while he was camping in Iceland . 
 After emerging into bitter sub-zero temperatures from his tent he spotted a female and male fox copulating . 
 But the pair weren't alone - a third Arctic fox lurked nearby and wasted no time in battling his rival for the female . 
 The losing fox was seen by the photographer limping off up a snowy hill and wasn't expected to last the night .
