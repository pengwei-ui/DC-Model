Keepers at the Columbus Zoo say ten-year-old Irisa had bred before but never conceived . 
 However, this spring it was found the female cat was pregnant . 
 While the birth on Tuesday  went smoothly, Irisa failed to show any maternal care so her offspring are being hand-reared in an incubator . 
 They currently weigh 2.5lbs but are set to grow to a heftier 650lbs .
