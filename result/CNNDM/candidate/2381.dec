Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said he is 'sightless in his right eye' following a New Year's Day exercise accident . 
  He said he has had 11 hours of surgery and is 'over' the fear that he may never see out of that eye again . 
  Reid sustained broken bones in his face while working out in his Nevada home with a plastic exercise band . 
  He announced last month he was retiring from the Senate . 
  Reid said in an interview this week that he was 'fortunate' that he only broke his face in his temple .
