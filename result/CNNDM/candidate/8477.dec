BAE System built the Typhoon on 'floating' concrete rafts that move in sync with the moon . 
  It is 49ft (15 metres) long from tip to tip and the material is 'no more than the thickness of a match stick' To counteract even the slightest shifts in gravitational pull, the jet fighter is built on rafts 59ft (18 metres) thick . 
  Two laser trackers and nine jacks are positioned on a single surface . 
  They control the alignment of the barges by cancelling out the subtle effects of the moon and tides . 
  The Typhoon is so accurate that even the movements of the tide can disrupt its positioning and accuracy .
