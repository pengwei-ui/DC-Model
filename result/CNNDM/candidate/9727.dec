Super speakers were found to have less activity in Broca's region of the brain . 
  This is the area involved in articulating and comprehending speech . 
  Neuroscientists at University College London scanned the brains of 17 professional comedians and a radio presenter . 
  The 'super speakers' showed less activity than a control group of students . 
  This suggests that the super speakers find speech less effortful .
