Donny Ray Williams on Friday was given a suspended sentence and 5 years probation for two 2010 sexual assaults . 
 Prosecutors spared Williams jail time largely because of his severe medical issues stemming from an unrelated 2013 acid attack . 
 WilliamsÂ was once a staffer for the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs disaster recovery subcommittees .
