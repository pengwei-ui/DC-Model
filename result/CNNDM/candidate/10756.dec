Alastair Cook has been working on a new stance with former England batting coach Graham Gooch . 
  But he appears to have overdone it against the West Indies in the first Test . 
  The England batsman was working on an open stance against India at Lord's in 2007 . 
  Cook has worked on a more open stance for the past few months . 
  But his front foot was far too open against West Indies . 
  England lost the first test by 13 runs in Grenada .
