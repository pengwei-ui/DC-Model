Audrey Alexander wanted her neighbours to chop down their huge hedge . 
 She claims the 40ft leylandii was blocking sunlight from reaching her home . 
 Feud started in 1980 when it blocked light from reaching a vegetable patch . 
 Council finally rules that the hedge can stay - but must be cut back to 20ft .
