The crumbling St Ivan Rilski Church is the only remaining evidence of the community of Zapalnya, Bulgaria . 
 Named after the patron saint of Bulgaria, the stone structure cuts a ghostly figure in the Zhrebchevo reservoir . 
 The settlement and two other villages were wiped out when the land was submerged in 1965 .
