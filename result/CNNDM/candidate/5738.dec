James Weld has stumped up Â£15,000 to restore steps to Durdle Door beach after three-year stand-off with Natural England over access to the beach . 
  The steps were washed away in storms in 2012 on Dorset's Jurassic Coast . 
  Mr Weld says Natural England 'shirked' its duty to pay for the steps under the Coastal Access Act 2009 . 
  The family had maintained the path down to the popular tourist attraction . 
  Natural England was handed responsibility for the coastal path in 2009 .
