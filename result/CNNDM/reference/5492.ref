Arnold Breitenbach of St. George, Utah, wanted to get 'CIB-69' put on a license plate . 
 That would have commemorated both Breitenbach getting the Purple Heart in 1969 and his Combat Infantryman's Badge . 
 The Utah DMV denied his request, citing state regulations prohibiting the use of the number 69 because of its sexual connotations .
