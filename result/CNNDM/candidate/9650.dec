Hayley Okines suffered from the rare disease progeria which ages the body at eight times the normal rate . 
  She became well-known three years ago when she was part of a documentary about her premature ageing condition . 
  Progeria patients normally die from heart attacks or strokes at an average age of 13 . 
  But Hayley defied the odds to live four more years and published an autobiography about living with the disease . 
  Last night her mother Kerry said she took her last breath at home .
