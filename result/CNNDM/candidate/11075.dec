Nicola Sturgeon demanded retirement age be frozen - in a move which would cost billions of pounds . 
  She said the rising retirement age was unfair for pensioners in Scotland because they don’t live as long as their counterparts in the rest of the country . 
  Miss Sturgeon said flat rate pension should increase to ‘at least’ £160 a week . 
  It is currently £113 .
