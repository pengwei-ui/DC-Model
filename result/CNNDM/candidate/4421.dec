Angela Postle from Maroochydore bought the oranges from a supermarket last month . 
  The mother-of-five said the fruit turned purple after she sliced it . 
  She sent the fruit to the Queensland Environmental Health Branch for testing . 
  The first round of tests failed to find the cause of the purple colouring . 
  Ms Postle said she is worried the phenomenon could be a more widespread problem .
