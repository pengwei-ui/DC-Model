Arthur and Mo Kreitenberg have created a robot, called the Germfalcon , which uses ultra violet light to kill bacteria throughout the cabin . 
  The seats, tray tables and blankets on an aeroplane are breeding ground for bacteria including E . 
 coli and MRSA . 
  Germs can linger for up to a week on aeroplanes and there are no clear rules on cleaning . 
  The device uses UV-C lamps to kill germs and is the size of a drinks cart .
