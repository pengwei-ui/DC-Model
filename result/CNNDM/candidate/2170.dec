Researchers at the University of Washington studied the telerobot Raven II  . 
  They found that robots designed for surgery could be 'easily' hacked in to . 
  This is because they are operated over public networks which allowed the researchers to access them and stop them working  . 
  The experts were able to take control of a robot during surgery by exploiting a simple programming trick . 
  This enabled them to change the speed of the arms of the robot and change their orientation . 
  The research was carried out on the Raven II teleoperated robotical surgeon .
