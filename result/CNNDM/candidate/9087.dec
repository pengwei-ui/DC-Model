Noaa Fisheries in Maryland says the humpback whale is no longer endangered . 
  They want to break up global population into 14 sub-populations . 
  Ten of these will be 'not at risk', two 'threatened' and two still 'endangered' It follows a conservation 'success story' that raised numbers to 90,000  . 
  However experts have warned it is too soon to declare the conservation project a success . 
  At one stage the worldwide population dropped to just a few thousand due to over-fishing and hunting . 
  The proposal is to reclassify the global population of humpback whales into 14 ‘population segments’ based on how they have recovered .
