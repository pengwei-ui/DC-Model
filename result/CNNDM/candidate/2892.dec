The Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative under- or over-reported millions of dollars in donations from foreign governments in their tax returns . 
  The charities will be refiling at least five years of tax returns and may audit returns as far back as 15 years . 
  The Clinton Foundation erroneously reported it had received no funds from governments for three years - even though it had previously received millions . 
  Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz has called on the foundation to return the money .
