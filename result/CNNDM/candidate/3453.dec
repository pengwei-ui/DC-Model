National Radio Astronomy Observatory claims iRobot's machines will interfere with its sensitive radio telescopes . 
  The company is famous for creating self-guided Roomba vacuum cleaners . 
  It has filed a request with the U . 
 S . 
  Federal Communications Commission to use airwaves for a radio wave-guided lawnmower . 
  The frequency band proposed for the lawnbot is 6240-6740 MHz - the same one several large radio telescopes operate on . 
  i Robot says the chances of its technology interfering with space exploration are 'infinitesimal'
