Rony John drowned in the River Great Ouse in July last year despite being unable to swim . 
  The teenager was swimming with friends in the river in Hartford, Cambridgeshire . 
  Coroner will write to Government chiefs to ask why swimming is not included in secondary school education . 
  Swimming is compulsory in primary school but not for those aged 11 or over . 
  Rony came to Britain from India in 2012 and did not know how to swim but was entitled to six lessons a year .
