Lindsey Vonn was back at Augusta Friday to watch boyfriend Tiger Woods play in the second round of the Masters . 
 Vonn looked stressed at times though Woods played a solid round, carding a three-under-par 69 . 
 Woods is still well behind the leader, hot young American star Jordan Spieth . 
 The 21-year-old broke the 36 hole record on Friday and is 14-under-par for the tournament, 12 strokes ahead of Woods . 
 Spieth led after three rounds last year and finished second at the tournament . 
 If Spieth wins he would tie the record
