More than 1,700 students from Yichuan Senior High School took the exam on Saturday in the first attempt by the school to allow pupils to sit exams in the open . 
  The students suggested and organised the outdoor exam themselves as there wasn't enough room inside . 
  The school said the reason was the lack of sufficient indoor space .
