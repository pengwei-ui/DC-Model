The Shcherbakov family adopted the bear cub after it wandered up to the gate at their home in Tulun, Russia . 
  The cub is unable to survive on its own after its mother was likely killed by poachers . 
  Family matriarch cooks porridge for the bear and feeds him from a refashioned beer bottle . 
  The family is hoping to find a new home for the cub and has placed adverts on the internet . 
  Wildlife experts say the bear will soon become a danger to the family .
