Researchers at National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan found the shape of a lip is determined by two competing groups of proteins . 
  They converted lips into petals in two orchid species using gene silencing . 
  Orchids have evolved a large and irregular modified petal to attract insects . 
  The shape of the lip was not known until now . 
  Researchers found the lip and petals are determined by the Perianth code .
