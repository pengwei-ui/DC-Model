Mar√≠a Jose Carrascosa was released from a New Jersey jail on Friday night after spending nearly 9 years behind bars for refusing to return her daughter to the United States . 
  The 49-year-old native of Spain moved her daughter back to Spain when the girl's father was granted custody of the child in 2006 . 
  She was paroled last year but defiantly refused to bring the child back to the US and was jailed for contempt of court . 
  Her daughter and estranged husband wrote letters to the court urging a judge to release her . 
  Judge agreed and ordered her release Friday night . 
  She says she plans to return to Spain as soon as possible .
