Reverend Creflo Dollar launched an appeal last month for 200,000 people to each donate '$300 or more' to buy a Gulfstream G650 . 
  He says his current plane is broken and he needs the plane to continue preaching . 
  He launched the appeal so that he could buy a $65million private jet with worshippers' donations . 
  The televangelist has defended the appeal and said 'the devil is trying to discredit' him .

  Dollar says the plane is needed to 'continue reaching a lost and dying world for the Lord Jesus Christ' He says the current aircraft is damaged and needs replacing .
