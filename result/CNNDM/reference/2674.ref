Sam Griner was just 11 months old when his mother snapped him clenching his fist on the beach and posted the image online . 
 Years later, she learned it had become the popular 'Success Kid' meme . 
 Sammy's father, Justin, has been on dialysis for six years and is in need of a kidney transplant so the family is now appealing for help . 
 They have set up a GoFundMe page to try to find him a kidney and to raise the $75,000 he will need for the procedure and medication .
