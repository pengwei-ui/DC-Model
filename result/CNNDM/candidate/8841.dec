Virgil van Dijk has been in fine form for Celtic but hasn't been called up to the Holland national team . 
  The defender has never been capped by Guus Hiddink . 
  Van Dijk believes the standard of Scottish football makes no difference to his chances . 
  He was happy for team-mate Jason Denayer to make his Belgium debut against Israel .
