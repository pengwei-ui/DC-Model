The Woolworths 'Fresh in our Memories' campaign launched last week . 
 It invited customers to upload images to remember Australians who fought for their country . 
 The supermarket then added a Woolworths logo and slogan to the images . 
 Customers took to social media to mock the campaign and express their anger with what they saw as a marketing ploy by the company . 
 Woolworths has taken down the campaign and also denied that it was designed as a marketing strategy .
