Adam Federici's error gave Arsenal a 2-1 victory in FA Cup semi-final . 
 Federici fumbled Alexis Sanchez's shot - allowing it to go through his legs . 
 Federici left the pitch in tears and apolgised for his error after the game . 
 FA Cup final is on May 30 - same day Federici will marry his girlfriend . 
 There is no suggestion, however, that he let the goal in on purpose .
