Students at Melbourne high school St Peter’s College were drinking from a bubbler dispensing recycled water for more than a year . 
  ‘Class A’ recycled water had been inadvertently connected to an outdoor drinking fountain . 
  The bubbler had been dispensing treated sewage water for 16 months . 
  The drinking fountain was shut down on April 1 and is no longer in use . 
  The water is not considered acceptable for consumption . 
  The students would have been at a greater risk of contracting gastroenteritis or diarrhoea .
