Brian Klawiter posted a message on his company's Facebook page announcing that openly gay people are not welcome at his business . 
 He claims the decision is based on his religious views and Michigan doesn't currently have laws in place preventing such discrimination . 
 Critics have accused him of trying to cash in on the anti-gay backlash which netted an Indiana pizzeria over $840,000 earlier this month . 
 Klawiter claims he doesn't need the money and has a successful business but at least one manfacturer has asked him to remove its logo from his site .
