Western gray whales were tagged seven years ago to monitor migration . 
 The then nine-year-old female called Varvara swam from Russia to breeding grounds near Mexico during five-and-a-half months in 2011 . 
 Gray whales typically don't feed during migration, which has led researchers to believe she didn't eat during the long journey . 
 Previous record was held by a humpback who swam 11,706 miles in 2011 .
