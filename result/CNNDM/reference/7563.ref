Lu Xincai says no one else can look after his 84-year-old mother . 
 She used to get lost after dark when she went to collect firewood . 
 Now she goes with him to work on the backseat of his motorbike . 
 He ties her to him with a sash to make sure she does not fall off . 
 She's now been given her own room at the bank where he works .
