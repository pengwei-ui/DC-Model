State broadcaster RTVE has axed plans for a reality show in Pamplona . 
  It would have seen celebrities pitted against each other to outrun fighting bulls . 
  The corporation caved in after the town's authorities said they would refuse to cooperate . 
  Mayor said he feared the show would turn bull running into Big Brother . 
  Fifteen people have died and dozens are injured each year in the annual San Fermin Fiesta .
