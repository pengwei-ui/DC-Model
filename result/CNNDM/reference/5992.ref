Clorox has apologized for a social media misstep . 
 The company sparked outrage by tweeting 'where's the bleach' in reference to last week's introduction of new 'emoji' cartoons for iPhones . 
 Those cartoons included faces of people with black and brown skin . 
 The company says it was attempting a humorous reference to other emojis for objects like toilets and bathtubs that people use bleach to clean . 
 ItsÂ post hit a nerve when news reports and online discussions were focusing on the new collection of racially diverse faces .
