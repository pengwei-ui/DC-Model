Mohonk Mountain House is a 'castle' retreat 90 minutes from New York . 
 The hotel sits blissfully on the banks of Lake Mohonk in the Hudson Valley . 
 The hotel was originally built as a drinking inn 145 years ago before Quaker twins Albert and Alfred Smiley made it a dry retreat - the bar is now open .
