Instagram has rolled out a tool to let users search for hashtags using emoji . 
  But when people try to search for the aubergine emoji hashtag no posts appear . 
  This is even though posts have been tagged with the eggplant emoji on the app . 
  The emoji is commonly used to represent male genitalia and may be attached to images containing nudity . 
  The hashtag was released as part of Instagram's latest update . 
  But searches for the gun and needle emoji are allowed . 
  Instagram is not commenting on the anomaly . 
  Last night the app let users create and search for emoji hashtags .
