K-9 Angels charity has rescued hundreds of stray dogs from Romania and re-homed at least 700 in the UK . 
  Singer Pola Pospieszalska and former Playboy model Victoria Eisermann are devoted to saving the animals . 
  'euthanasia' of strays was legalised by the Romanian parliament in 2013 . 
  Charities estimate there are up to one million free-roaming dogs on the streets . 
  They say state-appointed 'dog catchers' are 'clubbing to death' and 'waiting to die' in squalid state-run pounds . 
  Angels claim government funds for programmes aimed at neutering the animals were never implemented .
