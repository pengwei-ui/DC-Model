More than 2,000 perfectly preserved inscriptions were found on the walls of an underground cave in Naours, France . 
 They were left for posterity by young men facing the horror of trench warfare a few dozen miles away at the Somme . 
 Experts believe the bored young soldiers used their spare time to visit the caves, which are well known locally . 
 Only weeks later they were sent to the Somme battlefields, where more than a million men were killed or injured .
