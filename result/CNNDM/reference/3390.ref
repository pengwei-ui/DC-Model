Dr. Anthony J. Moschetto allegedly had the office of another doctor torched and tried to have the doctor hurt or killed . 
 Moschetto allegedly hired an undercover cop in a failed attempt to carry out his biddings . 
 Investigators who went to Moschetto's home in Long Island found a secret gun room accessible through a motarized bookshelf . 
 'He had enough weapons to provide a small army means to wreak harm,' said Police Commissioner Thomas Krumpter . 
 Moschetto faces a maximum sentence of eight to 25 years
