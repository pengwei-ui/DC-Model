Vlad Tarasov couldn't resist skiing down the slopes at Boston's largest snow farm located in the city's Seaport District . 
  He filmed himself pushing through the filthy ice pile that served as a dumping ground for the historic winter snowfall . 
  Boston received nearly 65 inches of snow in February and the city had to pay volunteers $30 an hour to dig out .
