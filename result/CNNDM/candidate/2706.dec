University of Southampton study found 'marine photic zone euxinia' took place in one of the oceans 200 million years ago . 
  This happens when the surface waters of the ocean become devoid of oxygen and poisoned by hydrogen sulphide . 
  Life of the Triassic met a choking end in a runaway greenhouse climate . 
  Study authors fear that the planet today could suffer similar consequences caused by the burning of fossil fuels .
