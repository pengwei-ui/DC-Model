Jin Pai was standing on the rim of a toilet in Hefei Xinqiao International Airport when it smashed to the ground . 
  The 35-year-old was hospitalised with deep cuts on his leg and buttocks . 
  He said he was squatting on the toilet because he was 'worried it might not be clean' But he was caught out when the toilet tipped over and cut him in several places . 
  He was waiting to board a plane in the city of HeFei in eastern China .
