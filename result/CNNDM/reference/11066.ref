Richard Lapointe, a former dishwasher, confessed to raping and stabbing 88-year-old Bernice Martin at her Manchester apartment in 1989 . 
 He was sentenced in 1992 to life in prison without parole . 
 Lapointe's supporters said evidence showed he could not have committed the crimes and his disability made him vulnerable to a false confession . 
 Last month a court ruled Lapointe was deprived of a fair trial and on Friday, a judge ordered him to be freed on $25,000 cash bail .
