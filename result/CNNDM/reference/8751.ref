Abbott Government are actively trying to stop parents who don't immunise their children from accessing rebates . 
 Only parents who immunise their children are eligible to access welfare payments and childcare subsidies .

 Conscientious objectors are people who oppose vaccinations for personal or philosophical reasons despite knowing the risks . 
 Scott Morrison confirms the government wants to take a more hard-line approach in the interest of the health and safety of Australian children .
