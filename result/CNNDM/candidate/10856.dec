Chlorine gas was used for the first time on April 22, 1915 . 
  It was carried by favourable winds over Flanders Fields from German positions . 
  Some 1,200 French soldiers were killed in the chaos of that first five-minute gas attack . 
  On Tuesday the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will hold a commemorative meeting close to the fields .
