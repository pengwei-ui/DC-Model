Mother was at charity Easter egg hunt at Melbourne's Caulfield Racecourse . 
 A volunteer at the event on Saturday told her to stop taking too many eggs . 
 She told the 13-year-old to 'f*** off' and continued to deny she was doing it . 
 But she became so rowdy security guards had to throw her out of the hunt . 
 The Easter event was held to raise money for Zaidee's Rainbow Foundation . 
 Foundation aims to make people more aware of organ and tissue donation .
