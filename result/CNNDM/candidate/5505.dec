Elizabeth 'Elle' Edmunds established an online fundraising page claiming she had ovarian cancer in August 2014 . 
  The 31-year-old mother was charged with two counts of obtaining benefits by deception . 
  Police alleged she used a falsified doctor's certificate stating she had terminal cancer to raise about $2500 from her page . 
  Ms Edmunds told a court she was forced to fake the illness by her violent partner John Heagney . 
  She was issued a court notice this week for the offence . 
  In April last year she told her family she had cancer and was given three years to live .
