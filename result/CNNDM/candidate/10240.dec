Dennis Sears changed his will to leave everything to live-in home help Nermin Kancefer months after she moved in to his Â£615,000 flat . 
  He disinherited his surviving relatives who had been intended beneficiaries for 20 years . 
  His family claimed the carer exploited the childless widower who had Parkinson's disease and died at the age of 87 . 
  But she insists Mr Sears had a change of heart after falling out with his family . 
  His estate included his three-bedroom flat in Walton-on-Thames .
