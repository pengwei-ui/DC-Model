Inscriptions were found in Naours - a two-hour drive north of Paris - and left for posterity by young men facing the horror of trench warfare a few dozen miles away at the Somme . 
  Photographer Jeff Gusky has tallied 1,821 individual names: 731 Australians, 339 British, 55 Americans and 662 others . 
  The inscriptions were written on the walls of a cave 100 feet beneath the French countryside . 
  They were left just weeks before they were to join the fighting on the Western Front .
