George Osborne refused to rule out lowering the 45p top tax rate to £50,000 . 
  He said the issue was 'not a priority' for the Government . 
  Instead he said the Conservatives are committed to raising the tax-free personal allowance from £10,000 to £12,500 . 
  Those earning between £31,866 and £150,000 are taxed at the higher rate of 45p . 
  Labour has called for the 40p rate to be raised to 50 per cent for those in the top bracket .
