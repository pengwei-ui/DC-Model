Some owners of the Apple Watch have found the sensors malfunction when worn on tattooed wrists . 
  Some dark, vibrant ink seems to cause the watch’s heart rate monitor to lose connection and give inaccurate readings . 
  Tests suggest tattoos in dark and solid colours interfere with the device the most . 
  It appears the pigmented ink of some tattoos affects the watch's sensor . 
  This is because the sensor can’t distinguish between blood and tattoo . 
  Apple has yet to comment on the issue .
