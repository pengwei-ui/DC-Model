This residence was once just a garage for a much bigger mansion called Homeden . 
 When Homeden was being converted into flats the owners of the garage bought some of the original features . 
 The blackwood and copperlight archway was taken and tastefully adapted to suit the light-filled property . 
 The stylish 740 square-metre, four bedroom, converted residence will go to auction on 16 May .
