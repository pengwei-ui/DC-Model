The president took a jab at the Wisconsin governor during an interview with NPR Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep . 
 Obama was responding to Walker's claims that he'd 'absolutely' cancel or 'disown' a deal with Iran on 'day one' if elected to higher office . 
 Jab at Walker departed from the White House's general strategy of staying out of the race to replace the sitting president . 
 Walker fired back on Twitter: 'Americans would be better served by a President who spent more time working with governors & Congress rather than attacking them'Obama defended the informal agreement his administration made with Iran
