Orange County Fire Authority paramedic Chris Trokey was part of a team that saved a driver's life after his car was hit by a truck in 2011 . 
 When he went to the hospital, he learned the man was Dr Michael Shannon - the same man who saved his life when he was born weighing 3lbs . 
 The two men reunited this weekend at a fundraising event .
