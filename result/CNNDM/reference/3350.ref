Josh Meekings was given a retrospective one-match ban for a handball . 
 The incident wasn't punished in Inverness's Scottish Cup win over Celtic . 
 The ban, which is being appealed, would rule Meekings out of the Cup final . 
 Celtic wrote to the SFA asking why why no penalty or red card followed . 
 Jim Boyce said he was speaking in a personal capacity, not for FIFA .
