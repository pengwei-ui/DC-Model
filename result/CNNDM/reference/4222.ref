Tidwell Middle School student - aged 13 or 14 - started the blog in August . 
 It was called 'Killing Children' and about 'me murdering people I hate'Stories named classmates and described either killing, maiming or sexually assaulting them . 
 The boy was taken out of school earlier this year and investigated . 
 He was allowed to return last month, with the school district saying the stories were 'horror fiction' and not real . 
 Local parents are outraged and staging protests outside the school .
