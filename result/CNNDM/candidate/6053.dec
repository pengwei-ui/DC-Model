Mandy tried out the best ice cream makers on the High Street . 
  The Swan Come Dine With Me Ice Cream & Gelato maker is best for dinner parties . 
  The Sage Smart Scoop by Heston Blumenthal is a fantastic ice cream maker but bulky and expensive . 
  John Lewis Chillle Ice Cream Maker is the best for budgets .
