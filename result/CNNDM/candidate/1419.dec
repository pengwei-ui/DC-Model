The Bruno Smartcan is said to be the first internet connected combined kitchen bin and vacuum cleaner . 
  It uses sensors to detect when you want the lid to open and activate its integrated vacuum . 
  Dust swept close to the bin activates the vacuum to suck it directly into the bin bag . 
  Bin also has an integrated bag store and can send alerts when it is low on bags . 
  The bin is expected to cost $248 (Â£160)
