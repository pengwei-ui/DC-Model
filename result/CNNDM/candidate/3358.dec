Psychologists from Goldsmiths University in London and Ohio State University studied more than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 . 
  They found 40 to 50 per cent of the differences in childrenâ€™s motivation to learn could be explained by their genetic inheritance from their parents . 
  Genetics and non-shared-environment factors were found to have the largest effect on the motivation . 
  The shared environment had negligible impact on motivation .
