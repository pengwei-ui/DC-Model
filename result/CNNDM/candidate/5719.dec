Three planets orbit the star HD 7924 at a distance closer than Mercury orbits the sun . 
  The discovery was made using the Automated Planet Finder (APF) in California . 
  The planet system is 54 light-years away and orbits the star in just 24 days . 
  APF is hoped to help in the search for Earth-like planets in other solar systems . 
  It consists of a 2 . 
 4-metre automated telescope and a high-resolution spectrograph . 
  All three planets in the system are unlike anything in our solar system .
