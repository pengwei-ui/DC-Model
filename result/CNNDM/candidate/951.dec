The Great Dying struck the Earth 252 million years ago and wiped out 96% of species . 
  Scientists at the University of Edinburgh analysed rocks on the ocean floor . 
  They claim volcanic eruptions released huge amounts of carbon dioxide which were absorbed into the oceans and changed their chemical compositions . 
  This caused the oceans to become more acidic and lasted for 10,000 years . 
  The amount of carbon added to the atmosphere to trigger the mass extinction was 'probably greater than today's fossil fuel reserves'
