The three eight-week old puppies were found inside the box on April 18 . 
 A woman saw the box, left outside of a Tennessee Goodwill donation site, moving and approached it finding the dogs . 
 The Labradors were taken to McKamey Animal Center for treatment which said the animals have worms and are malnourished . 
 It also said it is likely dogsÂ have been neglected over an extended period of time due to their poor condition . 
 Since beginning treatment, they have been flourishing and will be put up for adoption once treatment is complete .
