The 'horrific' Mudgeeraba Caravan Village is home to over 100 people . 
 Queensland Police patrol the site daily due the extreme level of incidents . 
 It has seen a fatal house fire, stabbings, brawls, and continual violence . 
 Ambulance officers will only enter the park under police protection . 
 ‘We’ll get up to mischief here on occasions,' owner Bob Purcell said .
