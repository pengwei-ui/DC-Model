Koral Reef, 20, died last year after a horrifying and protracted battle against the little-understood parasite Balamuthia mandrillaris . 
 Reef was wed to her high school sweetheart in July 2013 just months before she began showing symptoms like headache, fatigue and stiff neck . 
 Reef's mother Sybil Meister believes Reef picked up the amoeba on a trip to Lake Havasu in May 2013 -- she was dead by October 2014 .
