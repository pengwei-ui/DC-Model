Yaphet Kotto starred as Dr Kananga in the 1973 James Bond film Live And Let Die . 
  He said the role was created by Ian Fleming for a white actor and should be portrayed that way . 
  Kotto said 'political correctness be damned' and the role should be played by a white man . 
  Hackney-born Idris Elba has been tipped to replace Daniel Craig as Bond .
