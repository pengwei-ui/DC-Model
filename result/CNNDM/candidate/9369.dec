Harvard-led study has mapped taste buds on a tongue for the first time . 
  Scientists examined the different cells used to identify taste and watched these cells capture and process molecules live . 
  It reveals how taste buds have different cells that are used to differentiate between the five basic flavours . 
  The researchers used a specially designed microscope system to image single cells on the tongue of a mouse . 
  Shining a bright infrared laser on the mouse’s tongue caused different ‘flavour molecules’ to fluoresce .
