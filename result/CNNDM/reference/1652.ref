Court rules American bulldog Winston must leave his home this month . 
 Pet's attacks led to 14-month ban on  deliveries on two Blackburn roads . 
 His owner Hayley Sandiford claims Winston is 'not a danger' to anyone . 
 'Unfortunately he does have a thing about postmen but it is the mail they carry and not the postmen themselves', she said . 
 Winston's eviction means that postal deliveries will resume on May 1 .
