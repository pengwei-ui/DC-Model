Vietnamese labourer Pham Quang Lanh had a metal plate inserted over his skull after being struck by an iron bar on a building site . 
  But the botched operation caused his head to become swollen with a potentially deadly infection . 
  Family noticed a dozen maggots crawling under the skin of his head . 
  Doctors say the infestation ate the infected tissue and saved his life .
