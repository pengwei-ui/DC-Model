Pennsylvania scientists found 50 galaxies emitting unusually high levels of radiation . 
  This could be because aliens are harnessing the power of stars . 
  The study was led by Dr Jason Wright from Penn State University . 
  These galaxies were found to be emitting ‘unusually high’ levels of infrared radiation - possibly indicating ‘the presence of a highly advanced civilisation’ Within these galaxies, the researchers said it was possible that an alien race could be harnessing power of the stars . 
  None have been confirmed yet - but the findings are considered promising .
