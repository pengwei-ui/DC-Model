The Aaron Hernandez jury and alternate jurors sat down as a group with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday . 
 The jury wanted to make it known that they gave Hernandez a fair trial and did not let his notoriety get in the way of their difficult decision making . 
 Hernandez, 25, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on Wednesday for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd . 
 Before his arrest, Hernandez was a star tight-end for the New England Patriots, with a $40million five-year contract .
