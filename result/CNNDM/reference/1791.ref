Hannah and Alex needed a place to live after they moved back to New Zealand from the UK in 2009 . 
 So, they purchased a 1986 Hino flatbed truck and started building a home on the back of it over the course of about a year and a half . 
 They then purchased a secluded piece of property and drove their nearly self-sufficient $25,000 home there .
