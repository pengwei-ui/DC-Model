Leah Rogers and Ryan Flanaghan bought a rare Princess Diana Di Beanie Baby for £10 at a car boot sale in Bude, Cornwall . 
  The purple teddy is one of just 100 made for the Princess of Wales Memorial Trust . 
  They are now selling it on eBay with a starting bid of £20,000 - and hope to use the money to buy a house .
