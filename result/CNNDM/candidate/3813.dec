Researchers at the University of Arizona found the bombardier beetle mimics a machine gun by mixing chemicals in an internal 'reaction chamber' in its stomach . 
  When threatened, the bug can fire streams of foul-smelling liquid from its rear . 
  It can even precisely aim the nozzle at the attacker . 
  The behaviour was caught on camera by the researchers . 
  The research also solves a long-standing mystery of how the bugs achieve their rapid-fire capabilities .
