Hattie Gladwell, 19,Â blogs about her experience of living with an ostomy bag after undergoing emergency surgery for ulcerative colitis . 
 She is calling for a new anti-smoking advert to be banned because it warns  that they might get colon cancer and be forced to use a bag like her . 
 'I am utterly disgusted that they feel they can advertise a quit smoking campaign with something that has saved so many lives' she wrote . 
 She complains that the ad suggests people who use bags have brought the condition on themselves .
