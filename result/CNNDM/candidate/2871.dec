Bournemouth Borough Council apologised for the gaffe at yesterday's Bournemouth Bay Run . 
  300 runners were sent on an unscheduled two-mile detour after a race marshal took a toilet break  . 
  They should have been directed at a junction point but continued past the unmanned marshal point and had to run for an extra three kilometres . 
  The gaffe happened during yesterday's 10km fun run at the weekend . 
  Council has appealed for those affected to contact them .
