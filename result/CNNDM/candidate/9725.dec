England captain Alastair Cook was out for 76 on day three of the second Test in Grenada . 
  Jonathan Trott scored 59 in the first innings of the first Test at St George's Park . 
  Cook has struggled to score runs in areas where he can drive the ball . 
  The England skipper was spot on for the first hour of his innings . 
  He left the ball outside off stump and made the bowlers come to him . 
  But he was through the shot too early and was bowled by Shannon Gabriel .
