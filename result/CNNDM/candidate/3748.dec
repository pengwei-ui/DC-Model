YouTube user Elman511 cracked open the over-sized egg that was laid by one of his hens . 
  He said it was double the size of a normal egg . 
  The unusual occurrence is caused when a second oocyte (yolk) is released by the henâ€™s ovary before the first egg has been laid . 
  This causes the hen to form another egg with two yolks and white inside .
