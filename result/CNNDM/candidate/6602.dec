Stacey Johnson was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour in 2007 . 
  She has undergone gruelling chemotherapy and her sister Dannii has been her full time carer . 
  In December 2014 Stacey was told her tumour had grown but was benign . 
  But last year she was shocked to discover her sister had a growth in her brain . 
  Both sisters were born with neurofibromatosis type 1 - a condition that causes benign lumps and bumps . 
  Stacey has been told her sister also has a tumour but hers is benign .
