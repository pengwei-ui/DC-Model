Marina Lyons took her dog Rosie for surgery to remove her spleen due to a suspected tumour . 
  She took the Lhasa Apso to the PDSA PetAid Hospital in Hull for the operation . 
  When she returned home she discovered bruising on the dog's back . 
  The vet told her it was from the surgery and told her the burns were from a heat blanket used during the recovery . 
  Ms Lyons took the dog for a second opinion and discovered third degree burns on her back . 
  Rosie had to have a further operation to remove dead skin from the burn .
