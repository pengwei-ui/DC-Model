Amanda Burleigh was convinced that clamping the cord within seconds of delivery was wrong . 
  Doctors and midwives have clamped the cord since the 1950s to reduce the risk of haemorrhage . 
  Ms Burleigh believed it was unnatural to clamp the cord when it was still pulsating . 
  She has won a decade-long campaign to change the guidelines . 
  NICE now states that doctors should not cut the umbilical cord within a minute of birth .
