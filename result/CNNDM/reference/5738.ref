James Weld had to stump up £15,000 to restore steps to the beach  at Durdle Door which were washed away in 2012 . 
 Decision ends a three-year stand-off with Natural England over who was responsible for access to tourist attraction . 
 In 2009, Natural England was handed responsibility for the country's coastal paths under the Coastal Access Act . 
 But the government body claimed steps weren't part of coastal route and refused to pay for repairs for three years .
