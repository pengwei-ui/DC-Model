Kenneth Stancil made his first appearance in a North Carolina court on Thursday after he was transferred from a Florida jail . 
 In an expletive-filled rant, he told the judge he knew he was going to get life in prison but shot dead his boss for wanting to molest his brother . 
 His victim, Ron Lane, and brother had never met and there were no complaints against Lane when he was shot dead on Monday . 
 Stancil has admitted that he partly shot Lane - who had been his work supervisor before he was fired last month - for being gay .
