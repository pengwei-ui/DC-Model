Riot erupted in February 2012 when supporters of home team Al-Masry and Cairo's Al-Ahly clashed after an Egyptian league match . 
  An appeals court ordered the retrial of 73 defendants last year after rejecting a lower court's verdict which sentenced 21 people to death . 
  The clashes in the Port Said stadium sparked days of violent protests in Cairo . 
  Eleven of the fans were again sentenced to death today . 
  Their verdicts have been referred to Egypt's supreme court .
