Sofia Vergara's attorney said Friday the actress has no intention of destroying the frozen embryos she created with ex Nick Loeb in November 2013 . 
  Loeb filed a lawsuit asking a judge to order her not to destroy the embryos . 
  His lawyer said Friday that the actress 'has never wanted to destroy her embryos' but has no plans to use them either . 
  The couple created the embryos six months before they split in May 2013 . 
  Sofia is content to leave the embryos frozen 'indefinitely as she has no desire to have children with her ex'
