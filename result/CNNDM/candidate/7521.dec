Small fort was discovered on top of Dunnicaer sea stack close to Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire . 
  Archaeologists believe the stronghold was built by the Picts to protect the sea . 
  The fort was cut off from the land at high tide and could only be accessed by climbing up the cliff . 
  It was built with stone imported from elsewhere in the country . 
  Stones used to build the fort were engraved with Pictish designs . 
  It may have been one of a number of forts along the east coast of Scotland .
