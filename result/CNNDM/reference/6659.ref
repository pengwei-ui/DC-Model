Governor David Ige said he hasn't decided if he will sign bill into law yet . 
 Bill has $10 fine for first-time offenders, increases to $50 for next offenses . 
 Similar bans exist in Hawaii County and New York City . 
 Bill's opponentsÂ say it would be unfair to allow people to join the military but prohibit them from smoking a cigarette because of their age .
