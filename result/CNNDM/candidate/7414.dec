Pascal Tessier is the nation's first openly gay Eagle Scout . 
  The Boy Scouts' New York chapter said Thursday that it has hired him as a summer camp leader . 
  Tessier has been a vocal advocate of opening the organization to gay scouts and leaders . 
  His hiring is in contrast to the national scouting organization's ban on openly gay adult members . 
  The national organization changed its policy in 2013 to allow openly gay kids as scouts .
