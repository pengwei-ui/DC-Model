Joan Langbord and her sons found the coins in a bank deposit box for her father Israel Switt in 2003 . 
  The government claimed the $20 Double Eagles were stolen from the US Mint in Philadelphia in 1933 . 
  The coins were almost all melted down when the US went off the gold standard . 
  A jury found in 2012 that Switt stole the coins from a mint but an appeals court overturned the verdict .
