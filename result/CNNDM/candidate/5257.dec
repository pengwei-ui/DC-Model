Australian woman was getting ready for a party on New Year's Eve when she started to wheeze and cough up blood . 
  She reached for her inhaler but it was uncapped and she thought it was a loose connection . 
  X-ray showed the earring was lodged in her right bronchus - the airway leading to the lungs - and was covered in mucus . 
  Doctors said her case highlights the dangers of storing inhalers without a cap .
