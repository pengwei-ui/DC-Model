Brae Carnes of Victoria, British Columbia is protesting an amendment to a Canadian transgender rights bill . 
 It would allow business owners to determine if they want to allow transgender individuals to use facilities corresponding with their gender . 
 Carnes has now begun posting photos of herself applying makeup and even changing in men's public bathrooms . 
 'I’m actively showing them what it would look like if that became law and how completely ridiculous it is,' says Carnes .
