Tiny copper coin dates from the Iron Age almost 2,300 years ago and suggests links between the south west of England and the Mediterranean . 
  It was found in silt after the River Avon burst its banks between Bristol and Bath . 
  Experts have dated the coin to between 300 BC and 264 BC and say it came from the Western Mediterranean - probably Carthage . 
  On one side of the coin there is a horseâ€™s head and image of the goddess Tanit . 
  The find suggests that the village of Saltford was on a major trade route long before Roman times .
