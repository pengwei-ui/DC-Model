Jonny Bucknell was eating in the Camden Council chamber . 
  Labour rival Theo Blackwell spotted him and alerted other councillors . 
  Camden mayor Lazzaro Pietragnoli interrupted the meeting to tell him off . 
  Mr Bucknell says he was unaware eating was banned in the chamber . 
  In 2013 he slept in his car at the Tory party conference to save money . 
  He now wants a rule change so he can eat a roast dinner at meetings .
