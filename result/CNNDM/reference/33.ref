MicroCon 2015 is the first North American gathering of micronations . 
 Places like Molossia, Westarctica and Vikesland will be in attendance . 
 One country is the size of a football field, another is as large as Alaska . 
 They print their own stamps, wave their own flags, and mint their own money . 
 But most of their citizens don't actually live on the land .
