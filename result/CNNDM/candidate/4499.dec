Xiao Zhengti was born with a congenital liver condition meaning he needed his first transplant at just nine months old . 
  Mother Yang Haiying donated part of her liver but his body rejected it and he spent four years in hospital . 
  Father Xiao Kunqing was found to be a match and offered to donate 40 per cent of his liver yesterday . 
  Xiao is now expected to make a full recovery after the operation .
