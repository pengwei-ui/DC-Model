Paul the Apostle converted to Christianity after experiencing a bright light and a divine voice in Syria in 30 AD . 
  He was blinded for three days and he heard a thunderous sound and saw a light in the sky . 
  Astronomer Dr William Hartmann says these descriptions match accounts of the fireball that streaked across the sky above Chelyabinsk in Russia in 2013 . 
  He says the light and sound may have been caused by a meteorite . 
  Paul was also blinded and was on a road to Damascus at the time .
