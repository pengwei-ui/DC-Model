Mexican archaeologist Sergio Gomez found 'large quantities' of liquid mercury in a chamber at the end of a tunnel sealed off for 1,800 years in Teotihuacan . 
  Gomez has been excavating the ancient city for six years and hopes that the mercury will lead him to the tomb of a king . 
  He is unsure why the mercury was in the tunnel but believes it may have had a supernatural significance for ritual ends .
