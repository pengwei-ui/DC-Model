Albertville, Alabama high school junior Joy Webb, 17, took her grandfather James Drain, 80, as her date to prom last Saturday . 
 The teen says she asked her grandfather to be her date because he never got to attend his own prom . 
 Drain was 17 when he enlisted in the Navy to serve in the Korean War, so missed his own high school dance .
