Mitzi Neyens, 77, was the last link in a chain of 34 kidney transplants . 
  Neyens received a kidney because her husband Bill gave his kidney to a patient in need . 
  The National Kidney Registry matched her with a Philadelphia man after her age barred her from receiving a deceased donor . 
  The chain began with a Minneapolis attorney who gave a kidney to her brother in need of a transplant . 
  On March 26, Neyens became the 34th person in the world to receive a kidney after her husband gave his to a stranger .
