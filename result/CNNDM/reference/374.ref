The popular food chain's new spring menu includes a 650-calorie chicken-filled pretzel roll and a 400 calorie bagel . 
 Each of the chicken pretzel rolls contains 68% of your recommended daily allowance of salt . 
 The new menu contains one 'healthy' option, a 210-calorie steak wrap - which still contains 25% of your daily saturated fats . 
 Cardiologist Dr Kevin Campbell explained to FEMAIL that the menu items are full of 'empty calories' that have 'little or no nutritional value'
