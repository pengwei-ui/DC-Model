Earth's continents are expected to form a new supercontinent called Amasia in 50 to 200 million years . 
  In 2012 a study suggested this may be centered on the North Pole . 
  Curtin University geologist Dr Zheng-Xiang Li travelled to Nepal to study how the Indian and Eurasian plates are moving together . 
  Using new techniques, he can compare this to the ancient supercontinents Rodinia and Pangaea . 
  Earth's land masses are slowly moving together to form Amasia . 
  The Pacific Ocean is narrowing and will collide with Eurasia . 
  North and South America will crunch together, with the Caribbean Sea and Arctic Ocean disappearing . 
  And Asia will join the Americas .
