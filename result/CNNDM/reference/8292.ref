Tom Moffatt, 27, from Ashton-under Lyne, tried to ink 'Riley' into left arm . 
 But instead of 'L', he started needling letter 'P' - and had to scribble it out . 
 He also attempted to write Riley's nickname 'Sonny Boy' - but ended up scratching 'Sony Boy' across knuckles instead . 
 NHS worker is having laser removal to try and rid of the botched inkwork .
