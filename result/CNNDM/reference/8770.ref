Budi was introduced to Jemmi less than a month ago and now the two apes appear to be inseparable . 
 Indeed, video from the International Animal Rescue's orangutan center in Indonesia, shows the duo throwing adoring glances at each other . 
 Budi was dying from malnutrition and too weak to move when he was discovered in Borneo, Indonesia, last December . 
 Meanwhile, eight-month-old Jemmi was orphaned when her mother was killed and then illegally sold as a pet .
