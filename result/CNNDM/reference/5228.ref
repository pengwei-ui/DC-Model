Joan Langbord, in her mid-80s, and sons win back ten 1933 Double Eagles . 
 Family had brought rare coins to Secret Service when they were taken . 
 Coins from Langbord's father Israel Switt had been in a lock box until 2003 . 
 Very few of the $20 coins exist because FDR ordered US off gold standard . 
 Government said Switt stole them, though he could have traded for them .
