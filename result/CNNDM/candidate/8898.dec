Gold Coast personal trainer Ashy Bines mistakenly advertised the price of a yearlong program as $US49,500 per year . 
  Ms Bines apologised to her 'very angry and upset' followers after an extra zero was added to the cost . 
  The real price of the program is $4,950 . 
  She said it was meant to be 10% of the price but 'there was a mistake in the wording'
