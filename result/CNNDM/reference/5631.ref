Owner Lansdown has ploughed his fortune into the club through love and nothing else . 
 That strategy racked up enormous debts when they lost the Championship play-off final in 2008 . 
 Lansdown wrote off an eye-watering Â£35million worth of debt last year . 
 He is more pragmatic with his money nowadays and City are on the brink of a return to the second tier .
