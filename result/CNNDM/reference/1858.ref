Around Australia men and women flocked to play two-up after attending Dawn and Memorial Services on Anzac Day . 
 The game dates back to Australia's goldfields and the first recorded games took place in the late 1790s . 
 Two-up is illegal on all days apart from Anzac Day as it is considered a form of gambling . 
 Versions vary between the original two-coined game and three-coined version . 
 Pennies are placed on a paddle and are thrown into the air for people to bet on ('heads' or 'tails')
