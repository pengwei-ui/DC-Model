Some villages exist in what would be considered as uninhabitable places around the world . 
 They have thrived by adapting to the natural surroundings and some remain hidden away from the rest of the world . 
 Hidden villages can be found in the middle of the Grand Canyon, in clay structures on rock faces, and underground .
