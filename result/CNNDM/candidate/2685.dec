New book claims Bradford City fire was just one of at least nine fires at businesses owned by Stafford Heginbotham . 
  The fire at Valley Parade claimed 56 lives and injured 265 in 1985 . 
  Gerry Sutcliffe does not believe a new inquiry into the disaster is justified . 
  He says he is convinced the fire was an accident and was started by a spectator .
