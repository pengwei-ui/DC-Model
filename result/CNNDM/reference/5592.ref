Bob McDonnell used his office to benefit a nutritional supplement company whose president lavished gifts on him and his wife . 
 His lawyers argue that he never performed any 'official acts' for Star Scientific, a company that sought support for his 'Anatabloc' supplement . 
 McDonnell was sentenced to two years in prison and his wife got one year and one day; they're both free pending appeals . 
 Three-judge federal court panel will hear the former governor's appeal on May 12 .
