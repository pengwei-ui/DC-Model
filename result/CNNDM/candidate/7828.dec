Wanquan Castle was built in 1393 and was protected by an imposing 12-metre outer wall . 
  The fortress was known as the 'Martial City' and repeled all attacks by the Mongolian armies . 
  Archaeologists are now working to restore the outer wall of the fortress in China . 
  The work will be done in the style of the Ming Dynasty and is due to be completed in 2016 .
