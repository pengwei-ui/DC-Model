The pelican was captured in Santa Barbara, California by video maker Scott Kaiser  . 
  The bird opens its mouth to show off the size difference between the two parts of its beak . 
  It then rolls its head right back and opens its air sacs to expose its tongue and inner bill anatomy . 
  The bizarre slow motion footage was captured on a post overlooking the water .
