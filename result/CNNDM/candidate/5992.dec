Clorox tweeted 'where's the bleach' in reference to last week's introduction of new 'emoji' cartoons for iPhones . 
  The maker of bleach says it was attempting a humorous reference to other emoji symbols for objects like toilets and bathtubs . 
  The corporate Twitter post hit a nerve when news reports focused on the new collection of racially diverse faces . 
  Clorox has apologized for the tweet and said it did not mean to offend .
