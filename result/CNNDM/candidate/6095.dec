Sutherland Shire Council is exploring the idea of allowing overseas backpackers to park their campervans in allocated locations right on the beach . 
  Among these locations are Cronulla beach and Wanda beach . 
  Many tourists bypass these beaches due to a shortage of accommodation . 
  This motion was proposed by Councillor Steve Simpson due to the economic boost backpackers bring to the area .
