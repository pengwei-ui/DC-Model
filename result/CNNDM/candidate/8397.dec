Jasmine Midgley was born with a birthmark on her neck . 
  Her parents were told it was nothing to worry about and she had bronchiolitis - a common infection of the airways . 
  But at 10 weeks old the mark had started growing into her throat . 
  It was almost closing over her airways and choking her . 
  Doctors diagnosed a rare condition called a subglottic hemangioma . 
  Jasmine was treated with medication to shrink the blood vessels . 
  Parents Tanja and Steven were warned she may not survive .
