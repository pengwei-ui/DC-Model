Biologists at Durham University spent four months recording gibbon calls . 
 They recorded gibbons making 450  'hoo' calls from 25 animals that were impossible to distinguish with the human ear and were often inaudible . 
 Each call was found to relate to different contexts like foraging, meeting neighbours, singing to mates or warning others about a predator nearby . 
 Hoos about birds of prey were the quietest so not to alert the predators .
