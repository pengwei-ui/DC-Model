The photo was taken on Easter Monday morning at sunrise in Queensland . 
 Brad Allan was going out fishing when he looked out at the horizon . 
 He says the eerie image of a solider was the remnants of storm clouds . 
 He says the photo is fitting for the upcoming centenary of Anzac Day . 
 This year more than 15,000 Australians will attend overseas events commemorating the 100th anniversary of Gallipoli .
