Sarah Jewell, 25, went to local Social Security office to prove she's alive . 
 She learned someone had filed her number as deceased in November 2014 . 
 Jewell said the office implied 'everything's taken care of' and she was fine . 
 But after three months her number hasn't been reinstated, she hasn't received her tax refund, and her driver's license also lists her as deceased . 
 And now she's in jeopardy of losing her job as a licensed pharmacist .
