Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s Young Woman was replaced by a hand-painted replica ordered from China for £70 . 
  Visitors were challenged to spot the replica among 270 Old Master paintings at Dulwich picture gallery . 
  Chief curator Xavier Bray said visitor numbers quadrupled after the 'spot the fake' challenge in February . 
  Only 10 per cent of the 3,000 people who visited the gallery guessed right . 
  The replica has hung in the gallery since February 10 .
