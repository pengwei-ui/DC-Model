Heather Mack avoided the death penalty last week after she brutally killed her mother in Bali . 
  She was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of Sheila von Wiese-Mack . 
  Andrew Chan and Muyran Sukumaran were executed on Wednesday after they were convicted of trying to smuggle heroin from Bali to Australia in 2005 . 
  The Bali Nine ringleaders have spent the past decade on death row . 
  Mack was given a light sentence after a judge said she needed to care for her newborn . 
  In contrast , Chan and Sukumara were sentenced to death . 
  The differences in the sentences in the two cases have raised questions about the justice system .
