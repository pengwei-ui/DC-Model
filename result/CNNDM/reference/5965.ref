Italian musician Andrea Furlan was filmed playing in Milton Keynes . 
 He holds a hand-made ‘butterfly landscape’  designed didgeridoo . 
 As he plays a tune  some of the cows lift their heads and take note . 
 Suddenly the whole herd are compelled to run towards the sound . 
 They stand rooted to the spot for the duration of the composition . 
 Andrea described moment as 'an amazing and humbling experience'
