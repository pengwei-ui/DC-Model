Roger Varian says he has not lost faith in Dewhurst Stakes winner Belardo . 
 Belardo beat only one home in Saturdayâ€™s Greenham Stakes at Newbury . 
 Varian's determination to avoid fast ground means colt may head to France . 
 He is likely to target French 2,000 Guineas rather than British equivalent .
