Neanderthals died out around 40,000 years ago . 
  Archaeologists at Boston University and the University of Bath used computer models to see how much energy they could get from their food . 
  They found that without fire they could not get as much as modern humans who used fire . 
  This would have meant they lost out when modern humans arrived from Africa .
