Scientists in Colorado have found evidence for a new solar season cycle . 
  Every two years it appears 'bands' of magnetic field move to the surface of the sun . 
  This combines with the existing 11-year solar cycle . 
  The new season occurs when twisted bands of magnetic fuel reach the sun every two years - in addition to its existing cycle . 
  When the seasons combine, the activity of the Sun can be amplified . 
  This can cause powerful coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares .
