The designer diffusion line went on sale Sunday morning but was almost completely sold out online before noon, with stores selling out minutes after opening . 
 Re-sellers initially tried to unload merchandise at inflated prices including $799 for a $150 hammock; now thousands of pieces are available on eBay with smaller markups . 
 Outraged customers have formed a social media campaign to boycott the merchandise from second-hand sellers .
