Quincy Hazel and Sabrina Golden-Hazel have been charged with child neglect in Riviera Beach . 
  The couple allegedly locked their 17-year-old boy and girl in a closet for days on end and forced them to eat from a bucket . 
  They never took the children to a doctor or dentist and never enrolled them in school . 
  A relative said the family had 11 children but the two were the only ones subjected to the treatment . 
  The boy ran away from home last month and was found living on the street with his parents .
