Judge Denzil Lush said the elder sister could be jailed for attempting to alter a legal document to gain greater control over her mother’s money . 
  The mother has dementia and lives in a care home in Stoke Mandeville . 
  One of the sisters is a retired GP and the other a radiographer . 
  They agreed in 2007 that they should control her money and property . 
  Judge said both were unsuitable to control her affairs ‘because of the intense acrimony between them’
