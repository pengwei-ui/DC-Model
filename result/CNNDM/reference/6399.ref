Dr Warren Weinstein died during the counterterrorism operation in January . 
 The 73-year-old was captured from his home in Lahore, Pakistan, in 2011 . 
 His family are said to have transferred money to his kidnappers in 2012 . 
 They asked for the release of prominent Afghan prisoners in return . 
 The transaction did not lead to his release and his family have since slammed the US government for their 'disappointing' reaction . 
 US officials insist the family will be receiving compensation for his death .
