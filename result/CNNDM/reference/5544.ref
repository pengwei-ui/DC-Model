Patrick Cherry will be placed on desk duty before being transferred out of the NYPD's Joint Terrorism Task Force division . 
 Cherry was investigated by the Civilian Complaint Review Board after an Uber passenger recorded meltdown . 
 'No good cop should watch that video without a wince,' NYPD Police Chief Bill Bratton said at a press conference Wednesday . 
 Cherry was reportedly on his way back from visiting a colleague in hospital . 
 The Uber driver 'honked' at Cherry as he pulled into a parking space without signalling .
