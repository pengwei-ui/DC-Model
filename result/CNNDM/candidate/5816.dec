Kate Roberts noticed her son Miles had a different shaped head when he was born . 
  At three months he was diagnosed with flat head syndrome - when the back of the head becomes flattened, causing the head to widen and the front of the skull to bulge out . 
  Doctors believe it is caused by babies sleeping on their back . 
  As it is not medically dangerous, the NHS does not pay for treatment . 
  Mrs Thomas raised Â£2,000 in just one day to pay for a helmet for her son .
