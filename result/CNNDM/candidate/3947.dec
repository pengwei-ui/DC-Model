Police arrested 12 protesters Thursday when they tried to block trucks heading to the summit of Mauna Kea where one of the world's largest telescopes is being built . 
  Native Hawaiian groups do not oppose the Thirty Meter Telescope itself but disagree with the location of the construction on the mountain . 
  The mountain is considered a home of deities by Native Hawaiians . 
  Some consider the $1 . 
 4billion project as desecrating the Big Island .
