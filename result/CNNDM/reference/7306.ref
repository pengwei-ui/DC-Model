The Yeo Valley staff canteen is said to be best in the world and offers restaurant-quality food at subsidised prices . 
 Its 120 dairy workers can tuck into a meal for as little as £2 and now the canteen has been opened up to the public . 
 Locally-sourced food is prepared by Michelin-trained chef Paul Collins against stunning backdrop of the Mendips .
