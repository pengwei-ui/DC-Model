Rangers winger David Templeton is full of praise for the impact of new boss Stuart McCall . 
 He feels that the new regime is far better than that under Ally McCoist and Kenny McDowall . 
 Templeton has singled out a new-found intensity and more astute tactics as reasons behind the recent upturn in fortunes at Ibrox . 
 Rangers go into Saturday's game with Championship title-winners Hearts off the back of two consecutive wins .
