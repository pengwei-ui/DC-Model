Spanish researchers say climate change impacted human migration . 
  Until 1 . 
 4 million years ago it was too cold to inhabit southeast Spain . 
  But then the climate warmed to 13°C (55°F) and became more humid . 
  This enabled hominins - our distant ancestors - to move to new regions . 
  Researchers believe that the spread of our distant human ancestors had been halted by colder and drier temperatures . 
  But as conditions warmed, they were able to branch out from Africa into Spain and spread across Europe . 
  The theory is based on analysis of the Barranco León site in the Guadix-Baza Basin in Spain .
