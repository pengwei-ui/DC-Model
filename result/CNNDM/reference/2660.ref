The technology billionaire pursued a sale of struggling electric-car company Tesla to Google in 2013 for $6 billion . 
 Musk demanded that he be permitted to run Tesla as a unit of Google for eight years, or until Tesla produced a third-generation car . 
 Negoitations promptly ended in May 2013 when his company unexpectedly yielded its first profit and he no longer needed the finanical support . 
 The claims are made in the new biography Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX And The Quest For A Fantastic Future .
