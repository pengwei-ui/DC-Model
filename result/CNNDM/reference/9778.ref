After beating Tommy Burns in 1908, Jack Johnson became the first ever black world heavyweight champion . 
 He held the belt for six years and Sunday will mark the 100 year anniversary of his last title defence . 
 During a particularly racist period of American history, Johnson's title reign was met with many protests . 
 Johnson was eventually defeated by Jess Willard in 1915, following 26 brutal rounds in the sweltering heat of Cuba .
