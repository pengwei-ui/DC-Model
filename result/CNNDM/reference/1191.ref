Stegosaurus fossils have been found with two different types of plate along their backs - large broad plates and taller sharper plates that are smaller . 
 Experts long believed they belonged to separate species of stegosaurus . 
 New research found the different shapes may distinguish male and females . 
 Palaeontologists say the plates could have been used to help attract a mate .
