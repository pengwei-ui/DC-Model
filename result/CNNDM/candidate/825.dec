Tracy Spraggins has suffered from Lupus since she was six . 
  In 2013 she was told she needed a kidney transplant but would have to wait seven years . 
  Husband PJ was a perfect match but his blood pressure was too high for surgery . 
  He lost 145lbs in a year so he could donate his kidney to his wife . 
  Tracy and PJ underwent the operation together in February .
