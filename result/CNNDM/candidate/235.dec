Bath Abbey could have the world’s first natural underfloor heating system sourced from spring water in Roman drains . 
  The Church of England plans to harness the energy of the city's 45°C spring water to power a modern heating system for the building . 
  Engineers plan to excavate ancient crypts below the church to tap into the Great Roman Drain . 
  Warm waste water from the baths would enter a hidden thermal heat exchange and heat the Abbey . 
  Each day 850,000 litres of spring water flow through the drain to the River Avon . 
  Church leaders believe the scheme will reconnect the abbey with its Roman roots .
