Biologist Dr Joe Hanson has calculated what the human body is in terms of chemical elements . 
  He says a 'human molecule' might contain 375 million atoms of hydrogen and 132 million of oxygen and 85 million of carbon . 
  By comparison, a human body contains just one atom of cobalt and three molecules of the metal molybdenum . 
  The average adult body contains around 16kg (35lbs) of carbon and enough oxygen to fill 6 elephants .
