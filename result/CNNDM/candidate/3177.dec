Adele Sarno has been living in her two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan for more than 50 years . 
  Her landlord is the Italian American Museum which is dedicated to the legacy of Italian-Americans and is situated below her home . 
  She received a letter seeking to increase rent to the market rate of $3,500 a month . 
  This is far more than the retired shopkeeper can afford . 
  She has lived in the apartment since 1962 when rent was only $150 . 
  A judge has given her lawyers until April 13 to find a solution .
