Scooter's Coffee in Omaha was hacked for 24 hours on Sunday . 
  Staff were locked out of the page after an employee clicked on a malicious link in an email . 
  The 'unknown third party' then took control of the Facebook page and posted pornography . 
  The images were similar to those posted on Delta Air Lines and Crayola's pages after they were hacked .
