Labour leader Ed Miliband pledged to crackdown on the illegal exploitation of migrant workers in a speech in Wirral West . 
  He said exploitation has driven low-skilled migration and held down wages for British workers . 
  A new unit of 100 staff would work with the Gangmasters Licensing Authority and Home Office enforcement . 
  But Nigel Farage and Tory Immigration Minister James Brokenshire dismissed his ideas . 
  They said he was doing nothing to control immigration . 
  Mr Miliband insisted that there was an 'epidemic of exploitation'
