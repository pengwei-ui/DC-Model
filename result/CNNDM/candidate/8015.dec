Kim Copeland was walking home from her local Sainsbury’s store in Coventry when she threw the used cigarette on the ground . 
  Two council officers came ‘sprinting’ towards her to say she had committed a criminal offence . 
  She was issued with a £50 fixed penalty notice but refused to pay it . 
  After failing to pay she was told to appear at Nuneaton Magistrates’ Court and fined £304 .
