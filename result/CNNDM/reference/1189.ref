Vlad Tarasov couldn't resist filming himself ski down the slopes at Boston's largest snow farm located in the city's Seaport District . 
 HisÂ one-minute video gives a first-person perspective of  pushing through the filthy, trash-filled ice pile that served as a dumping ground for the snow . 
 'I've been skiing for 20 years, but never like this,' he said about the 'surreal' experience . 
 Junk in the filthy snow included rusted lawn chairs, parking cones, broken bottles and even a dead seagull .
