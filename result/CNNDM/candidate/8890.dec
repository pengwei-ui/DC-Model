Three eight-week old Labradors were found inside of a sealed cardboard box on April 18 near a Tennessee Goodwill donation site . 
  The dogs were covered in urine and suffering from heat exhaustion . 
  The puppies have worms and are malnourished, and it is likely they have lived their entire lives in a cage . 
  The box was labeled 'stuff animals' and had no food or water inside .
