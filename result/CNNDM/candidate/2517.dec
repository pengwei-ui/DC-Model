Federal MP Bob Katter released a statement accusing the Queensland Government of assuming Billy Gordon would quit after he was accused of domestic violence . 
  Mr Gordon was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week . 
  He later admitted to his criminal past and said he would remain an independent . 
  Mr Katter said the Government believes Mr Gordon is 'a little black puppet on a string' He has since defended the statement saying he used the term because he is of Lebanese descent .
