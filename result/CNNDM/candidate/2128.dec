Robert Durst was indicted Wednesday on the two weapons charges that have kept him in New Orleans . 
  His lawyers say he wants to go to Los Angeles as soon as possible to face a murder charge there . 
  A grand jury charged Durst with possession of a firearm by a felon, and possession of both a firearm and marijuana . 
  His arrest related to those charges has kept Durst from being extradited in the December 2000 death of a friend .
