A Los Angeles judge ruled this week that V. Stiviano must return $2.6 million in gifts she was given by former Clippers owner Donald Sterling . 
 Shelly Sterling said on Wednesday that she feels vindicated by the win and will be giving the money to charity . 
 She said that she and Sterling never split and, even though she drew up divorce papers last year, she never filed them . 
 The ruling came a year after the NBA banned Sterling for life over a recording of him telling Stiviano not to associate with black people .
