Jimmy Anderson could move past Ian Botham's record during first Test . 
 Anderson is just four wickets away from beating Botham's tally of 383 . 
 The Lancashire fast bowler has always been a natural swing bowler . 
 Lowest points of Anderson's career have come with too much tinkering . 
 Peter Moores deserves credit for allowing bowler to be himself for England .
