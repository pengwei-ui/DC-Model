Passengers on the MV Azores became unwitting pawns in a legal wrangle between a former crew member and the owners of the ship . 
  They were due to leave Lisbon for Bristol at 7pm on Tuesday but lawyers slapped a court order on the ship over an 'unresolved' and 'historic' financial wrangle . 
  Harbour master then refused to let the ship leave and passengers arrived back in UK 19 hours late . 
  Ship had been set to leave on Tuesday night with 489 passengers heading back to Bristol Avonmouth .
