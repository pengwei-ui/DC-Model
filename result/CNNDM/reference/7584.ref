Three tops with the error on the left sleeve sent to Hampshire Constabulary . 
 Chairman of Hampshire Police burst out laughing when he saw the mistake . 
 Two officers will continue to proudly wear the t-shirts despite the mistake . 
 They will only wear the tops 'internally' and not when they are out patroling .
