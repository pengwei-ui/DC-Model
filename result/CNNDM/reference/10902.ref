Tottenham forward Emmanuel Adebayor has taken to Twitter to insist his immediate future remains at White Hart Lane . 
 He has one year left to run on his current contract at Spurs . 
 Adebayor joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season convinced them to make the move permanent . 
 Unfortunately, Adebayor has not managed to rediscover his early form and has been reduced to a bit-part player in Mauricio Pochettino's plans . 
 He has not scored a league goal for Spurs since October .
