Real Madrid signed Norwegian teenager Martin Odegaard for Â£2.3million . 
 Odegaard dropped down to Castilla with team top of regional third division . 
 Results have picked up since the 16-year-old was dropped from starting XI . 
 Odegaard trains with first team and is not a cohesive part of Castilla side . 
 No one regrets Odegaard signing but he may go out on loan next season .
