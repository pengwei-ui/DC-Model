European Space Agency’s Rosetta spacecraft lost contact with Earth during a flyby of comet 67P on Saturday . 
  The spacecraft had dipped to within nine miles (14km) of the surface . 
  But it lost sense of where it was due to the amount of dust and gas on the comet . 
  It was placed into ‘safe mode’ and lost sight of Earth . 
  The problems arose due to Rosetta mistake comet debris for stars . 
  The probe launched into space in 2004 and entered orbit in August 2014 .
