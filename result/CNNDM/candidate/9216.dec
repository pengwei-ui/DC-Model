Government has approved funding for Cambridgeshire-based Mole Solutions to develop the idea of underground freight pipelines . 
  The Mole Urban project would transport goods in capsules to edge of town centres . 
  The idea is to reduce road congestion and pollution in urban areas . 
  Mole Solutions is currently testing the concept in Northampton . 
  If successful the concept could be rolled out in other towns .
