Clinton claimed Wednesday in Iowa that 'all my grandparents came over here' as immigrants . 
 She said last year that one of her grandmothers immigrated to Pennsylvania and worked in a silk mill . 
 But Buzzfeed found American Census records showing that only one Clinton grandfather, adn neither of their wives, was born outside the US . 
 Clinton apparently shaded the truth to seem more authentic with her argument that illegal immigrants should have more legal access to jobs .
