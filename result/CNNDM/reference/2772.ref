Jurors have started deliberations in the case against Pedro Hernandez, the man accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz in 1979 . 
 Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon asked jurors in the ten week trial toÂ convict Hernandez of murder . 
 She described him as a calculated killer who committed a terrible crime and then spent three decades trying to hide from it . 
 The defense says Hernandez's admissions are made up, the ravings of a mentally ill man who sees visions and has a low IQ .
