PETA released a new campaign accusing the wool industry of barbaric treatment of their sheep . 
  The Victorian Farming Federation launched an official complaint to the Advertising Standards Bureau on Monday . 
  The campaign shows vegan guitarist Jona Weinhofen holding a severed lamb . 
  PETA later admitted the lamb was a prop and made of foam . 
  The video shows Australian shearers kicking, stamping and mutilating the sheep . 
  Many have taken to social media to defend the industry . 
  Victorian Farmers Federation said the campaign is 'misleading and offensive'
