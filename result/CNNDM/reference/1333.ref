The Zambi Wildlife Retreat  is the only facility for retired exotic animals from zoos and the movie industry in Australia . 
 The Sydney retreat is home to lions, tigers, monkeys and dingoes as well as rescued farm and domestic animals . 
 The retreat is  hoping to raise money to expand its facilities so it can accept more animals and open a training centre . 
 Although not yet open to the public, you can now 'adopt' one of the Zambi pride to support the non-profit facility .
