Luke Lazarus was convicted of raping an 18-year-old at SOHO nightclub . 
 The 23-year-old Sydney man was sentenced to a minimum of three years . 
 He then bragged about it to a mate via a text message next day after attack . 
 Lazarus' lawyers are now appealing his conviction . 
 This comes as Waverley Mayor Sally Betts wrote a reference for him . 
 Liberal mayor asked for him not to receive a custodial sentence . 
 Says she is trying to 'close loophole' of 'risky behaviour' in young women .
