A 12-year-old boy found the world's largest European wasp nest ever found . 
 Jordan Waddingham made $20 from his mum for his startling discovery . 
 It measures at one metre tall and a circumference of three metres . 
 The nest was destroyed overnight when the wasps were dormant . 
 It took two days to remove the 90-kilogram nest from the ground . 
 The nest is being displayed at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery .
