Boeing 747 can normally hold up to 600 people but this model was customised for a single ultra-wealthy tycoon . 
 Digital images show how the interior is as luxurious as an expensive hotel room despite space constraints . 
 The jumbo jet contains a master bedroom, 'aeroloft' with added sleeping space, and a large dining room . 
 It is also kitted out for business with a conference room and office so the owner is never out of touch with work .
