Tina Sinatra laughed when asked if Frank Sinatra was the father of her brother Ronan Farrow . 
  She said he had a vasectomy so could not have fathered her son . 
  Mia Farrow had previously admitted the singer may be her father . 
  Sinatra and Farrow married in 1966 and divorced in 1968 . 
  She gave birth to Ronan in 1987 - he is her only biological child . 
  In 2013 she said Sinatra may be the father but they 'never split up'
