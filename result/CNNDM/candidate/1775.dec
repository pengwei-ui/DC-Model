Cassandra Fortin was discharged from Connecticut Children's Medical Center on Monday . 
  She was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in September . 
  She and her mother initially refused the recommended treatment because they wanted to explore natural alternatives . 
  But in January a court ruled she was not legally mature enough to make the decision and the Department of Children and Families gained temporary custody of her . 
  She has now finished the chemotherapy for the cancer . 
  The teenager said she was 'happy' to be heading back to her Hartford home .
