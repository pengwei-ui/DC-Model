Biologists at Goethe University Frankfurt studied the healing process at a molecular level using electron microscopes . 
  They found skin cells appear to attach to each other using tiny tubes that interlock like a zip . 
  Cells on either side of a wound 'sniff' each other to find their partners . 
  They then use the tubes to create a structure that works like a zipper . 
  The researchers hope their findings could help develop new treatments for wounds .
