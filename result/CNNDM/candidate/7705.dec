Engineers at the University of Sheffield found that tampons can glow in ultra-violet (UV) light because they absorb chemicals found in products containing ‘optical brighteners’ These chemicals are found in toilet paper, laundry detergents and shampoos . 
  The cotton products absorb chemicals and glow under UV light . 
  This could be used to detect pipes that shunt sewage into streams instead of treatment plants . 
  It’s estimated that around five per cent of homes in the UK have misplumbed pipes . 
  Tampons could shed light on previously undetectable pathways . 
  The technique was trialled in rivers and streams in Sheffield .
