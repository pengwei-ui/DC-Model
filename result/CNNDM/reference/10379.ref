Terrill Wayne Newman is vying to become the next KentuckyÂ governor . 
 On Tuesday he legally changed his name to Gatewood Galbraith after a late local celebrity who bid five times for the title but never won enough votes . 
 Newman says he doesn't expect to be elected but hopes the gesture will 'warm Galbraith's grave'
