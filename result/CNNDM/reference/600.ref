An Ocean photographer has captured the unique and surreal moment ocean foam hits the sand . 
 Surfer Lloyd Meudell formed a severe photography obsession after buying a GoPro two years ago . 
 He now shoots on a EOS 5D Mark III DSLR and uses numerous lenses but does not reveal his secrets . 
 The 'foam surrealism' pieces are shot on the south coast of NSWÂ at Kiama beach through to Gerrigong . 
 Mr Meudell's shots draw from works of surrealism such as Salvador Dali and appear very dream-like .
