Thousands of dead fish were found at a lake in Huizhou City in southern China's Guangdong Province on Friday . 
 Owner of a fish farm which operates from the lake says he found evidence the water was polluted with ammonia . 
 He claims the loss of 100 tonnes of fish overnight will cost him over 1 million RMB (£110,000) in potential sales . 
 Employees are working to save any live animals by adding salt to the water to restore the chemical imbalance .
