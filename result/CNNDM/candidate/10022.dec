Landmark Developments Ltd tore down a derelict property in Bath city centre to build a block of 14 flats . 
  Residents complained that the development was three feet higher and four feet wider than approved by the council . 
  Bath and North East Somerset Council says the developer committed a 'breach of planning control' and ordered the building to be bulldozed . 
  Planning permission for the development at 43 Upper Oldfield Park was granted in 2009 .
