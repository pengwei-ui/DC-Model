Underwear is on display at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen . 
  Traditionally known as a 'naatsit', the underwear is adorned with beads and would have been sewn together by a woman using strips of seal pelt . 
  It was obtained during an expedition to the Ammassalik settlement in Greenland in 1892 . 
  The naatsit is currently on display as part of the museumâ€™s animal-skin clothing collection .
