SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insists she will call the shots in the event of a hung parliament . 
  She vowed to use influence of dozens of MPs to get her way for the next five years without voting down the government . 
  Ms Sturgeon said she would act to 'lock' the Tories out of power and prop up a Labour government . 
  But she is not even standing for election to the Commons . 
  She said Ed Miliband will 'have to reflect how people have voted'
