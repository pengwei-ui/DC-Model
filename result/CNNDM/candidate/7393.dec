Nasa spacecraft is currently 18 miles (29 . 
 1km) above Mercury . 
  It is expected to hit the planet on 30 April after Nasa used the last of its fuel to push it higher into orbit . 
  The spacecraft is sending back the most detailed images of the planet in its four year mission . 
  Among the images is a picture of 2km high cliffs that formed as Mercury has cooled and contracted . 
  Researchers have also solved the mystery of Mercury's 'stealth' colour . 
  They say a steady dusting of carbon from passing comets has painted the planet black .
