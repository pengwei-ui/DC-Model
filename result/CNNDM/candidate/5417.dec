Geologist Dr Danny Hilman believes that a site in West Java is revered because it hides an ancient temple built between 9,000 and 20,000 years ago . 
  The megalithic site of Gunung Padang was discovered in 1914 and is the largest site of its kind in Indonesia . 
  If true, the pyramid could be four times older than Egyptâ€™s oldest pyramid . 
  It could also shed light on a powerful and advanced ancient civilisation . 
  The structure is hidden under rubble and is thought to have been built for worship or astronomy  . 
  The site is nestled among volcanoes and tea plantations .
