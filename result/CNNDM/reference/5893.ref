Prescott City Attorney Jon Paladini claims sole survivor Brendan McDonough heard an argument between the crew leader and his deputy . 
 Paladini claims McDonough told his secret to former city fire chief Darrell Willis . 
 Willis admits McDonough came to him to 'get something off his chest' but says it wasn't about infighting that occurred before the tragedy . 
 McDonough has also denied the accuracy of Paladini's account, but reports of it may alter lawsuits stemming from the tragic June 2013 fire .
