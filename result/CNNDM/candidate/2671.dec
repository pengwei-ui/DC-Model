Cody Neatis was admitted to Royal Preston Hospital last Thursday with a chest infection . 
  The eight-year-old has Down's syndrome, epilepsy and is fed by a tube . 
  He has had to sleep on a mattress on the floor as the hospital does not have a specialist high-sided cot he needs to sleep in . 
  His mother Lynne says she has waited two years for a suitable bed for him . 
  She fears he will injure himself or pull out his oxygen . 
  The hospital trust says it has ordered a special bed from America .
