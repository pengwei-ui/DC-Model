Josh Hamilton, 33, filed for divorce from his wife Katie in February - around the time he self-reported a cocaine and alcohol relapse . 
 Katie Hamilton is set to appear on the 10th season of Real Housewives of Orange County . 
 The couple married in 2004 and have four daughters but court documents show he is not allowed to see them without supervision . 
 An arbitrator ruled that he will not be disciplined for the latest relapse but Angels' owner Arte Moreno said Hamilton might not return to the team .
