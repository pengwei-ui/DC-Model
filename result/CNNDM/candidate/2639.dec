Kelly Rutherford claims her children were illegally deported to France when a California court awarded custody of her children to her ex-husband Daniel Giersch in 2012 . 
  She filed a lawsuit in New York claiming that the children should return to the U . 
 S . 
  from their father's custody in France . 
  The case was dismissed with a court order saying the federal court did not have the jurisdiction to order the children to come back to the United States . 
  A California court ruled two years ago that the kids should live in France with Griesch . 
  Rutherford filed for bankruptcy in March and said the children were ' illegally deported from the US' She divorced Giesch in 2010 after four years of marriage .
