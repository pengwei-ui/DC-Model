New Zealand woman Annah Sophia Stevenson ordered a Big Mac from McDonald's in Blenheim on Saturday . 
  She took three bites of her burger before she realised something was wrong . 
  Ms Stevenson pulled a half eaten cockroach out of her mouth . 
  The mother of one said the insect was in its guts and had a hole in the shell . 
  She ordered the meal after a stressful day of moving house . 
  McDonald's will pick up the evidence from Ms Stevenson .
