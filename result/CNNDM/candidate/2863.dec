Rodney Todd and his two sons and five daughters were found dead at their Maryland home on Monday . 
  Delmarva Power says it did not cut off power to the family because they were behind on their utility bills . 
  The utility discovered a stolen electric meter had been illegally connected to the rental home where the family was living since November . 
  The meter was disconnected for safety reasons on March 25 and the family then used a generator for power  . 
  Todd was last seen alive on March 28 . 
  Police found their bodies in the home after he failed to show up for work . 
  Todd had bought the generator to keep his children warm .
