Toby escaped out the back gate from his Wendy Stokes' garden in Kent . 
 He was picked up by a driver on a nearby road and taken to a rescue centre . 
 Six months later he was re-homed with a couple in Margate - 22 miles away . 
 Toby had 'Stokes' written on his shell so the couple tried calling every Stokes in Kent before reuniting him with Wendy 11 months after escape .
