Mario Valencia took a rifle from a Walmart in Tuscon, Arizona on February 19 and was able to start firing it as soon as he left . 
 The stolen weapon should have still been locked and police chasing the men were told he could not fire the loaded gun . 
 He was later taken out by an officer who hit him with his vehicle . 
 The gun was found to be locked with loose wire that was not wrapped enough when police recovered it from the scene . 
 Walmart claims the wire could have been knocked loose because of the impact from the car .
