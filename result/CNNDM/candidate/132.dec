Rare mammal has been making waves at the Taiji Whale Museum in southern Japan . 
  The animal was captured during the annual dolphin hunt in January last year . 
  It is believed to be only the second albino dolphin ever put on display in an aquarium . 
  It can turn pink when it's feeling angry, sad or embarrassed . 
  The phenomenon results from the animals thin skin .
