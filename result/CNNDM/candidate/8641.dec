A sapphire glass screen used in the Apple Watch was rubbed against a stone wall and keyed and hit with a hammer . 
  The screen remained unscratched even after being rubbed with sandpaper . 
  The test was carried out by Cardiff-based iPhone repairs specialist iPhoneFixed . 
  Two out of the three models of Apple Watch are available to pre-order from today . 
  The Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition both have Sapphire glass screens . 
  The only one that doesnâ€™t is the Sport model of the watch .
