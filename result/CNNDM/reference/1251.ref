Massey Shaw was requisitioned from the London Fire Brigade and helped rescue 600 troops from Dunkirk in 1940 . 
 The vessel went on to save St Paul's Cathedral during the Blitz before being commissioned in 1971 . 
 But the fire boat has been renovated and restored to its former glory by a group of volunteers thanks to lottery grant . 
 They are now seeking another Â£10,000 so they can transport the Massey Shaw back to Dunkirk 70 years later .
