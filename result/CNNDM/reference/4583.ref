Medical examiner's report described how Gray may have injured neck . 
 Theory claimed he fell forward while cuffed and hit his head on a bolt . 
 But specifications for the Chevrolet Express van show no such bolt . 
 Photographs of other Baltimore Police also contradict theory . 
 Gray's spine was somehow severed while in police custody on April 12 .
