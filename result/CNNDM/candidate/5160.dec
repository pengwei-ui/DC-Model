Australian choreographer Wade Robson claims Michael Jackson was a predator who repeatedly sexually abused him as a child . 
  He and another alleged victim James Safechuck have a hearing on Tuesday to decide if their respective claims proceed . 
  Lawyers say Jackson shelled out nearly $200 million to as many as 20 victims . 
  Robson and Safechucks missed a statutory deadline when they filed their claims more than a year after Jackson's 2009 death .
