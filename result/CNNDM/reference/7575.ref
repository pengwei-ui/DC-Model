The flexible aluminium battery was created at Stanford University . 
 It consists of a negatively charged aluminium anode and a positively charged graphite cathode along with an ionic liquid electrolyte . 
 It sits in a flexible polymer-coated 'pouch' and recharges in one minute . 
 But it currently offers just half the voltage of existing lithium-ion batteries .
