Anthony Ray Hinton was released from the Jefferson County Jail in Alabama on Friday morning after 30 years on death row . 
  He was convicted of the 1985 murders of two Birmingham fast-food restaurant managers . 
  Prosecutors admitted this week that they couldn't find evidence that a gun found at his home fired the bullets used in the murders . 
  Hinton declared 'The sun do shine!' as he walked free . 
  He said he should not have had to wait 30 years for investigators to test the gun . 
  The U . 
 S . 
  Supreme Court ruled last year that he was innocent .
