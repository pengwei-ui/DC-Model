Anthony Ray Hinton released 30 years after being in prison on death row . 
 Hinton was convicted of shooting to death two fast food restaurant mangers in two separate 1985 robberies . 
 Hinton was granted re-trial by the U.S. Supreme Court and experts found that there was not enough evidence to prove Hinton's gun shot the men . 
 'He was a poor person who was convicted because he didn't have the money to prove his innocence at trial,' said Hinton's attorney .
