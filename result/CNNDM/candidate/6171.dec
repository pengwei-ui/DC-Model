Villagers in Shaanxi Province dug a 46m well to get fresh drinking water . 
  But when they pumped the water to the surface they found it was so polluted they could set it on fire  . 
  Locals said they could smell petrol and gas coming from the well and blamed a leak from a local petrol station . 
  But Chinese officials say they found no trace of a leak and are investigating .
