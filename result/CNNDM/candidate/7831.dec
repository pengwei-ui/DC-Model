Researchers at the Technical University of Braunschweig in Germany found peppermint plants can take up nicotine from contaminated soil and plumes of smoke . 
  The finding may explain why some spices, herbal teas and medicinal plants have high concentrations of nicotine in them . 
  Nicotine was frequently used as an insecticide until it was banned by the European Union in 2009 . 
  Researchers have shown that passive smoking affects plants too .
