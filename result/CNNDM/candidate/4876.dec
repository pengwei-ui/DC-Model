California start-up Eaze has raised $10 million (£6 . 
 7 million) so that users can ‘find the perfect medicine’ in more states . 
  It allows people to choose medical grade marijuana and have it delivered by a vetted driver – providing they live in one of the US states where the drug is legal . 
  The sale and possession of marijuana for medical and recreational use is legal in Alaska, Colorado and Washington . 
  The app has been dubbed ‘Uber for weed’ and is rumoured to be backed by rapper Snoop Dogg .
